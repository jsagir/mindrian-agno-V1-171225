Not what features does your product have. Not what category does it compete in. Not what demographics buy it.\n\nWhat job is it being hired to do?\n\nThe answer isn't 'to have a better drill'\u2014that's describing the product, not the job. The answer isn't 'to be more efficient'\u2014that's too vague to be useful.\n\nThe answer is: to make a quarter-inch hole. And once you understand that, you realize the drill doesn't compete with other drills. It competes with anything else that could make that hole. Lasers. Punches. Pre-made holes. Adhesive strips that eliminate the need for holes entirely.\n\nMost innovators miss this. They obsess over making better drills. They add features. They study drill demographics. And they're blindsided when something completely different\u2014something that does the same job better\u2014destroys their market.\n\nThis is Jobs To Be Done\u2014a framework that shifts your entire perspective from products to progress, from features to outcomes, from what you sell to what customers are actually trying to accomplish in their lives.",

They did everything the textbooks told them. They surveyed customers. They segmented by demographics\u2014age, income, geography. They ran focus groups. They asked customers what would make the milkshake better. Customers dutifully answered: thicker, thinner, more chocolate, less chocolate, bigger cup, smaller price.\n\nThe company implemented the changes. Sales didn't move.\n\nWhy? Because they were asking the wrong questions. They were asking about the product instead of the job the product was being hired to do.\n\nThe Milkshake Revelation\n\nThen a researcher took a different approach. Instead of asking about the milkshake, he watched customers. He noted when they bought milkshakes. At what time. What they were wearing. Whether they were alone. What else they bought\u2014or didn't buy.\n\nHe discovered something remarkable: nearly half of all milkshakes were sold before 8:30 AM. To people in business attire. Alone. Who got in their cars and drove away.\n\nThe researcher started interviewing these morning customers. Not about the milkshake\u2014about their lives. And he discovered the job:",

I need something that won't make a mess on my clothes. And I need it to last\u2014I don't want to be hungry at 10 AM.\"\n\nThe milkshake wasn't competing with other milkshakes. It was competing with bagels (too messy, too fast), bananas (gone in three bites), donuts (guilt-inducing, crumbs everywhere), and coffee (not filling enough).\n\nThe milkshake was being hired for the job of 'Give me something engaging, clean, and filling for my boring commute.'\n\nThat's a completely different design brief than 'make the milkshake taste better.' And it leads to completely different innovations\u2014a thicker consistency (lasts longer), a narrower straw (takes more effort, lasts longer), fruit chunks (surprise moments), a commuter-friendly cup shape.\n\nWhy Demographics Fail\n\nThe demographic approach\u2014'18-34 year old males in suburban areas'\u2014tells you nothing about why someone buys. Two people with identical demographics might hire the same product for completely different jobs:\n\nA morning commuter hiring the milkshake for engagement and satiation\n\nAn afternoon parent hiring the same milkshake to be a 'good dad' (giving a treat to a demanding child)",

The afternoon job wants fast (kid needs to finish before they get home), small (minimal sugar guilt), interactive (fun for the child).\n\nDemographics describe who. Jobs describe why.\n\nWhere This Thinking Comes From\n\nClayton Christensen and the Theory of Jobs\n\nThe Jobs To Be Done framework was developed primarily by Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor best known for 'The Innovator's Dilemma.' But where that work focused on why good companies fail, JTBD focuses on why products succeed.\n\nChristensen's insight came from asking a deceptively simple question: 'What causes a customer to purchase a product?' His answer revolutionized how we think about markets:\n\n\"Customers don't buy products. They hire them to make progress in their lives.\"\n\nThis wasn't just semantic wordplay. It was a fundamental reframe. Products are tools for achieving outcomes. Understanding the outcome\u2014the progress the customer seeks\u2014reveals what truly drives purchase decisions.\n\nThe Origins: Theodore Levitt and Marketing Myopia",

Understanding the outcome\u2014the progress the customer seeks\u2014reveals what truly drives purchase decisions.\n\nThe Origins: Theodore Levitt and Marketing Myopia\n\nThe intellectual roots go back further, to Theodore Levitt's 1960 Harvard Business Review article 'Marketing Myopia.' Levitt argued that companies failed when they defined themselves by the products they made rather than the customer needs they served.\n\nHis famous example: railroads declined not because people stopped needing transportation, but because railroads thought they were in the 'railroad business' instead of the 'transportation business.' They let cars, trucks, and planes take their customers.\n\n\"People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.\"\n\nLevitt identified the problem. Christensen developed the systematic framework for solving it.\n\nContributing Thinkers\n\nThe framework has been enriched by numerous contributors:\n\nTony Ulwick developed Outcome-Driven Innovation, a systematic method for identifying the outcomes customers seek when 'hiring' products\n\nBob Moesta, who worked with Christensen on the original milkshake study, developed practical interview techniques for uncovering jobs\n\nAlan Klement contributed to understanding the emotional and social dimensions of jobs, not just functional ones\n\nTogether, they've created a robust methodology for understanding what progress people seek and why current solutions fall short.",

Functional Dimension\n\nThe practical, objective requirements. What does the person need to accomplish? This is the 'get it done' aspect:\n\n'Get to work on time'\n\n'Keep food fresh'\n\n'Communicate with colleagues'\n\n2. Emotional Dimension\n\nHow does the person want to feel\u2014or avoid feeling?

This is the external, relational aspect:\n\n'Be seen as successful' (nice car)\n\n'Be seen as a good parent' (healthy food)\n\n'Be seen as a team player' (responsive communication)\n\nProducts that address only the functional dimension often lose to competitors who address emotional and social dimensions too. People will pay more\u2014and be more loyal\u2014to products that make them feel good and look good, not just get things done.\n\nThe Four Core Principles\n\nJobs are stable even as solutions change. People have needed to 'get entertainment while traveling' for centuries. The solutions have evolved from books to Walkmans to iPods to smartphones. The job remains constant.\n\nJobs exist independent of your product. The job exists whether your product exists or not. This is crucial\u2014you don't create the job, you discover it.\n\nCircumstances are critical. The same person has different jobs in different situations. Don't confuse the person with the circumstance.",

Reed Hastings famously said Netflix competes with sleep. The job isn't 'watch a movie.' The job is 'relax and unwind at the end of the day.' Sleep does that job too\u2014and it's free.\n\nOnce you see your true competition, you can design for competitive advantage on dimensions that matter.\n\nWhat happens if you ignore this: You optimize against the wrong competitors and get blindsided when something outside your category does the job better.\n\nReason 2: It Identifies Underserved Needs\n\nJobs analysis reveals where customers are struggling\u2014where they've hired a product but it's doing the job poorly.",

Customers duct-tape solutions together. They hire multiple products to do one job. They spend excessive time on tasks. They feel frustrated.\n\nEvery workaround is an innovation opportunity. Every struggle is a problem worth solving.\n\nWhat happens if you ignore this: You keep adding features nobody asked for while customers continue to struggle with the basics.\n\nReason 3: It Creates Customer Language, Not Product Language\n\nJobs statements use customer language\u2014the way people actually describe their lives and goals. This has profound implications for:\n\nMarketing that resonates (because it describes the customer's world, not your product's features)\n\nSales conversations (that start with the customer's struggle, not your solution)\n\nProduct development (that prioritizes what matters to customers, not what's technically interesting)\n\nWhat happens if you ignore this: Your marketing describes features nobody cares about, your sales force struggles to connect, and your engineers build technically impressive products that customers ignore.\n\nReason 4: It Enables Predictive Innovation\n\nJobs are stable.

    "content": "nsight: One product was being hired for three fundamentally different jobs. Intercom reorganized their entire product and company around these three jobs\u2014creating distinct products and teams for each.\n\nImpact: This clarity drove product decisions, marketing messaging, and organizational structure. Revenue grew from $30M to $200M in four years.\n\nKey Lesson: The same product can be hired for multiple jobs. Understanding those jobs lets you serve each one better\u2014or choose which to focus on.\n\nCase Study 2: Snickers 'You're Not You When You're Hungry'\n\nThe Challenge: Snickers was just another candy bar in a crowded category. Share was stagnant.\n\nJobs Analysis: Traditional research said people ate Snickers for 'a chocolate treat.' But deeper investigation revealed a different job: 'Help me get back to being myself when I'm feeling off.'\n\nThe circumstance: That mid-afternoon slump when you're hungry and becoming someone you're not\u2014irritable, unfocused, unpleasant to be around. The job wasn't 'eat chocolate.' It was 'restore myself to my normal, capable self.'\n\nThe Insight: This job revealed competition wasn't other candy bars\u2014it was anything that could restore your true self: coffee, energy drinks, a quick walk, even just a break.\n\nImpact: The 'You're Not You When You're Hungry' campaign directly addressed the job. It didn't talk about chocolate, nuts, or caramel. It talked about the transformation\u2014from diminished to restored. Global sales increased by 15.9%.",

People didn't buy a candy bar\u2014they bought restoration of self.\n\nCase Study 3: IKEA and the Job of Furnishing\n\nThe Challenge: Furniture was sold the same way for decades\u2014showrooms full of individual pieces, sold by salespeople on commission.\n\nJobs Analysis: IKEA's founder, Ingvar Kamprad, understood a job that nobody else was addressing: 'Help me furnish my home affordably, starting now.'\n\nThe traditional furniture job statement: 'Help me buy quality furniture pieces for my home.' This led to expensive showrooms, commission sales, and 8-week delivery times.\n\nIKEA's job statement: 'Help me create a home I'm proud of, on a budget, without having to wait.' This led to completely different design choices:\n\nFlat-pack assembly (lower costs, immediate availability)\n\nRoom displays (inspiration, not just products)\n\nIn-store warehouse (take it home today)\n\nSwedish food (make the shopping trip an experience)\n\nImpact: IKEA became the world's largest furniture retailer by serving a job competitors weren't addressing.\n\nKey Lesson: The right job statement leads to a coherent system of design choices. Everything at IKEA\u2014from flat-pack to meatballs\u2014flows from understanding the job.",

Everything at IKEA\u2014from flat-pack to meatballs\u2014flows from understanding the job.\n\nAdvanced Concepts\n\nHiring and Firing\n\nCustomers don't just hire products\u2014they fire the old solution when they hire the new one. Understanding what gets fired reveals the real job.\n\nQuestions to ask:\n\n'What were you using before?'\n\n'What made you switch?'\n\n'What did the old solution fail to do?'\n\n'What do you miss about the old solution?'\n\nThe firing decision often reveals the job more clearly than the hiring decision.\n\nThe Four Forces\n\nEvery hiring/firing decision is driven by four forces:\n\nPush: What's pushing the customer away from their current solution? (Dissatisfaction, problems)\n\nPull: What's pulling them toward a new solution? (Promise, appeal)\n\nAnxiety: What concerns do they have about the new solution? (Risk, uncertainty)\n\nHabit: What keeps them attached to the current solution? (Comfort, familiarity)\n\nFor a switch to happen: Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit\n\nInnovation often fails because it focuses only on Pull (making the new thing attractive) without reducing Anxiety or overcoming Habit.\n\nJobs Hierarchy\n\nJobs exist at different levels of abstraction:\n\nBig Jobs: Life-level aspirations ('Be financially secure')\n\nLittle Jobs: Task-level needs ('Pay this bill')\n\nRelated Jobs: Jobs that cluster together ('Track my spending', 'Budget for the future')",

Non-consumption is when customers don't hire anything to do the job because nothing adequate exists.\n\nNon-consumption represents huge opportunity. These customers aren't comparing you to competitors\u2014they're comparing you to the status quo of struggle.\n\nSigns of non-consumption:\n\nPeople doing things manually that could be automated\n\nPeople avoiding activities because they're too hard\n\nPeople accepting poor outcomes because they don't know better is possible\n\nIntegration with Other PWS Tools\n\nJobs To Be Done + User Process Mapping\n\nProcess mapping reveals every step a user takes to accomplish a goal. Jobs To Be Done tells you what progress they're trying to make.\n\nTogether: Map the process, then for each step, ask: 'What job is being done here?' This reveals which steps are struggle points\u2014where the job isn't getting done well.\n\nJobs To Be Done + Macro-Changes\n\nMacro-changes (PEST analysis) show what's changing in the world.

Jobs analysis ensures you're thinking about those futures in terms of customer progress.\n\nTogether: For each scenario, ask: 'What jobs exist in this future?' 'Which jobs become more important?' 'Which current solutions become inadequate?'\n\nWhere Jobs To Be Done Fits in the PWS Methodology\n\nJobs To Be Done is a Week 3 tool in the Problems Worth Solving curriculum, positioned in the 'Ill-Defined Problems' phase.\n\nWhy Week 3?\n\nBy Week 3, you've explored the broad landscape of undefined problems\u2014you've thought about macro-changes, scenarios, and systems.

This is the definition of an ill-defined problem.\n\nThe job is defined. The solution is not. This is exactly the right problem space for innovation.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore Jobs To Be Done analysis, you should have:\n\nUnderstanding of your domain boundaries\n\nAwareness of macro-changes affecting the space\n\nAbility to conduct qualitative research\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nAfter identifying jobs, the typical next steps are:\n\nFour Lenses analysis to generate solution directions\n\nWhite Space Mapping to find unserved market opportunities\n\nProblem refinement to move toward well-defined problems\n\nCommon Mistakes in Jobs To Be Done\n\nMistake 1: Describing Solutions, Not Jobs\n\nThe Problem: 'Customers need a faster car' is not a job statement\u2014it's a solution statement disguised as a need.\n\nThe Reality Check: Job statements should be solution-agnostic.

Test by asking: 'Could this job be done by something completely different?'\n\nThe Fix: Reframe as progress: 'Help me get to my destination quickly and comfortably.' Now you can imagine solutions beyond cars\u2014telecommuting, moving closer, better public transit, autonomous vehicles.\n\nMistake 2: Ignoring Context\n\nThe Problem: 'Help me be entertained' is too broad. Without context, you can't design for the job.\n\nThe Reality Check: The same person has different entertainment jobs in different contexts\u2014commuting, waiting at the doctor, relaxing at home.\n\nThe Fix: Always include circumstance: 'Help me be entertained while waiting in a boring situation (where I can't make noise).' Now you can design for it\u2014earbuds required, short-form content, interruptible.\n\nMistake 3: Asking Customers What They Want\n\nThe Problem: 'What features would you like in a milkshake?' gets you incremental answers about milkshake features, not job insights.\n\nThe Reality Check: Customers don't know what they want. They know what they're struggling with.\n\nThe Fix: Ask about struggles, not solutions. 'Tell me about your morning commute.' 'What's frustrating about it?' 'What do you wish were different?' Let the job emerge from the struggle story.\n\nMistake 4: Missing Emotional and Social Dimensions",

'How do they want to be perceived?' The Snickers case shows emotional jobs can be more powerful than functional ones.\n\nMistake 5: One Interview, One Job\n\nThe Problem: Conducting a handful of interviews and declaring 'we found the job.'\n\nThe Reality Check: Jobs emerge from patterns across multiple conversations. One interview might reveal a unique situation, not a generalizable job.\n\nThe Fix: Interview until you hear the same stories repeatedly. When interviewees start telling you things you've already heard, you've found the real jobs.\n\nMistake 6: Confusing the Job with the Moment\n\nThe Problem: 'I need to check my email' seems like a job, but it's actually a task within a larger job.\n\nThe Reality Check: Ask 'why' to find the real job. Why check email? To stay informed. Why stay informed? To be responsive. Why be responsive? To be seen as reliable and capable.",

The real job is often about identity and progress, not tasks and features.\n\nMistake 7: Treating All Jobs as Equal\n\nThe Problem: Identifying ten jobs and giving them all equal weight in your product roadmap.\n\nThe Reality Check: Some jobs matter more than others. Some are better served by current solutions than others.\n\nThe Fix: Always map importance and satisfaction. Focus on jobs that are highly important but poorly served. These are your true opportunities.\n\nThe Ultimate Jobs To Be Done Question\n\nAfter everything we've covered, here's the question that should guide your innovation efforts:\n\n\"What progress are people trying to make in their lives that they cannot currently make\u2014or cannot make well?\"\n\nThis question contains everything:\n\nProgress: Not products, not features\u2014forward movement in someone's life\n\nPeople: Real humans with complex lives, not abstract market segments\n\nTrying: Active struggle, not passive acceptance\n\nCannot currently make: The gap between aspiration and reality\n\nOr cannot make well: The struggle with inadequate current solutions\n\nGreat innovators see the world through this lens.

They ask 'What progress is blocked?'\n\nThey don't study competitors. They study strugglers.\n\nThey don't optimize products. They enable progress.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nEvery purchase is a hiring decision. Every product is an applicant for a job. Your job is to understand the job.\n\nThe most successful products in history didn't win by being better products. They won by doing the job better:\n\nThe iPhone did the job of 'be connected and productive anywhere' better than separate phones, cameras, and computers\n\nUber did the job of 'get where I'm going safely and without hassle' better than traditional taxis\n\nAirbnb did the job of 'feel at home while traveling' better than hotels\n\nNone of these was the obvious next product in their category. They were better ways to do the job.\n\nWhen you truly understand the job\u2014functional, emotional, and social\u2014you see possibilities that competitors fixated on products will never see.\n\nThis is not just a framework. It's a fundamental reorientation from product-thinking to progress-thinking. Master it, and you'll never see markets the same way again.\n\n\"The job is what the customer hires the product to do.

Their turning point came when they stopped asking 'What features should we build?' and started asking 'What jobs are our customers hiring us to do?'\n\nThrough extensive customer research, they discovered their single product was being hired for three distinct jobs: acquiring new customers (sales), onboarding users (marketing), and supporting customers (service). Same product, three different jobs, three different success metrics.\n\nThey reorganized their entire company around these jobs\u2014creating distinct products, teams, and go-to-market strategies for each. Revenue grew from $30M to $200M in four years. The insight wasn't a new feature\u2014it was a new understanding of the jobs.\n\nCautionary Tale: Kodak's Product Myopia\n\nKodak invented the digital camera in 1975. They had the technology, the brand, and the market position. Yet they filed for bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nWhat happened? Kodak thought they were in the 'film business.' They optimized for film sales, film development, and film-related products. They saw digital as a threat to film.\n\nBut customers didn't have a job called 'use film.' They had jobs like 'capture memories,' 'share moments with family,' and 'document my life.' Those jobs didn't require film. They required whatever did the job best.",

Think of a product you use daily. What job does it do for you\u2014not what features does it have, but what progress does it enable?\n\n2. What would you 'fire' that product for? What would have to be true for you to switch to something completely different?\n\n3. When you think about your innovation domain, what do you think customers want? Now ask yourself: is that a feature or a progress statement?\n\nPHASE 1: FOUNDATION & DOMAIN DEFINITION\n\nIn this phase, you will define the boundaries of your jobs analysis and prepare for customer discovery.\n\nPhase 1 Objectives\n\nDefine a clear, researchable domain for analysis\n\nIdentify potential interview candidates\n\nPrepare interview guides using JTBD techniques\n\nDocument initial hypotheses about jobs (to challenge later)\n\nSTEP 1.1: Domain Selection\n\nYour domain defines where you're looking for jobs.

Let students sit with the discomfort of the Kodak example.\n\nThe Intel vs. Kodak case study pair (one success, one failure) should be discussed as mirror images of the same analytical framework.\n\nThe \"Five Steps\" section is the operational core. Ensure students can articulate each step before moving to advanced concepts.\n\nThe Common Mistakes section works well as small-group discussion: \"Which of these have you seen? Which are you most likely to commit?\"\n\nThe Workbook",

The temptation is to analyze products rather than technologies. Spend extra time on Step 1.1 (Domain Definition).\n\nThe peer checkpoints are NOT optional. Students consistently produce better work when they know their peers will review it.\n\nValidation criteria distinguish minimum requirements from excellence. Use the excellence indicators to motivate high performers.\n\nThe \"Opening Reflection\" is designed to create personal stakes. Students who identify their own technology dependency produce more rigorous analysis.\n\nThe Case Studies & Reference Library\n\nWhat it is: The evidence base\u201414+ detailed case studies, worked examples, annotated bibliography with 15+ books, historical context, failure pattern analysis, and teaching resources.\n\nHow to use it:",

The tool applies to AI technologies just as it does to any other.\n\n\"What if I can't find any limits?\" You haven't looked hard enough, or you've defined your domain too broadly. Every technology has limits. If you truly can't find limits, check if you're analyzing a product category instead of a technology.\n\n\"How far ahead can S-curves predict?\" S-curve analysis is more reliable at identifying position and direction than predicting exact timing. Within-5-year predictions are reasonable; 10+ year predictions are directional only.\n\n\"Do S-curves apply to services/software?\" Yes, but parameters differ. Software S-curves might measure processing efficiency, algorithmic performance, or capability scope. The underlying logic\u2014emergence, growth, maturity, limits\u2014still applies.\n\nFor questions about these materials, contact the PWS Program at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"Teaching S-Curve Analysis is teaching humility.

They saw it before anyone.\n\nThe answer isn't \"they were arrogant.\" Every company in history has been arrogant at some point.\n\nThe answer is: They couldn't read the S-curve.\n\nKodak's leadership watched their film business reach physical and market limits for two decades. They saw the sigmoid shape forming in their revenue graphs. They even funded digital alternatives. But they fundamentally misread where they were on the curve\u2014and more critically, they misjudged how much runway they had before the new curve would render their position obsolete.\n\nThis isn't ancient history. Right now, somewhere in your industry, a technology is reaching its limits. Right now, someone is placing bets on what comes next. The question is whether you can see it happening\u2014and whether you know what to do about it.\n\nMost organizations miss this entirely. They either:\n\nPanic too early, abandoning profitable technologies before extracting full value\n\nStay too long, riding the curve into irrelevance while competitors leap to the next one",

We draw a line through recent data points and extend it into the future. Our spreadsheets reward this thinking. Our planning cycles depend on it.\n\nBut technology doesn't improve in straight lines. It improves in S-curves.\n\nThe Linear Trap\n\nConsider the hard disk drive industry in the 1990s. Companies were achieving roughly 60% annual improvements in storage density. If you plotted this on a graph and extended the line, you'd predict continued dominance for decades. Investment analysts did exactly this. Storage executives planned based on exactly this.",

Eventually, magnetic recording hits fundamental constraints\u2014the superparamagnetic limit, where bits become so small they're thermally unstable. The industry was racing toward a wall they couldn't see in their linear projections.\n\nMeanwhile, flash memory was crawling along its own S-curve\u2014slower improvement, higher cost per gigabyte, but with dramatically different physical limits. Today, flash has displaced rotating storage in most applications. The companies that saw the S-curve transition captured the future. Those that didn't... didn't.\n\nWhy This Matters for Innovation\n\nHere's the gap this creates:\n\nTraditional planning assumes continuity. S-curves guarantee discontinuity.\n\nEvery technology has limits. Physical limits. Market limits. Adoption limits. When a technology approaches these limits, improvement doesn't stop\u2014it exhausts itself. The curve flattens. Returns diminish. And the conditions ripen for something new.\n\nThe organizations that thrive in this environment aren't the ones with the best technology.

It was discovered in biology.\n\nIn 1838, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst was studying population growth. He noticed that populations don't grow indefinitely\u2014they follow a characteristic pattern. Initial growth is slow. Then it accelerates exponentially. Then, as resources become constrained, it slows. The population approaches a limit asymptotically\u2014never quite reaching it, but getting progressively closer.\n\nThe mathematical model he developed produced a shape: the logistic curve. An S-curve.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how universal this pattern proves to be. It shows up in epidemic spread, in species colonization of new habitats, in the diffusion of innovations through societies, in the improvement of technologies over time. Something about the S-curve captures a deep truth about how systems grow and mature under constraints.\n\nThe Key Thinkers\n\nRichard Foster brought S-curve thinking to technology strategy with his 1986 book Innovation: The Attacker's Advantage. Foster, then a director at McKinsey, observed that established companies repeatedly lose to newcomers despite superior resources. His explanation: technological limits and the S-curve.\n\nFoster articulated two critical insights:",

Christensen observed that disruption often comes from technologies that initially underperform the incumbent\u2014but sit on a steeper S-curve. The disrupting technology starts weak but improves faster, eventually overtaking the established solution.\n\nEverett Rogers contributed the demand-side perspective with Diffusion of Innovations. While Foster and Christensen focused on technology performance, Rogers mapped how technologies spread through populations. His adoption curve\u2014moving from innovators to early adopters to early majority to late majority to laggards\u2014is itself an S-curve, but measuring market penetration rather than technical performance.",

When should you invest in the disruptor? And how do you know?\n\nThe Four Core Principles\n\nPrinciple 1: Every Technology Has Limits\n\nNo technology improves forever. At some point, fundamental constraints\u2014physical, economic, or social\u2014stop improvement. Understanding these limits is the first step in reading the curve.\n\nExample: Internal combustion engines have approached their theoretical thermodynamic efficiency limits.

Then something clicks, and improvement accelerates dramatically\u2014the \"growth\" phase. Finally, improvement slows again as limits approach\u2014the \"mature\" phase.\n\nExample: The first transistors required heroic efforts to produce. Then came decades of rapid scaling following Moore's Law. Now, further miniaturization faces quantum mechanical limits, and each generation requires exponentially more investment.\n\nPrinciple 3: The Danger Zone Is Where You Feel Most Comfortable\n\nAt the top of an S-curve, financial performance often looks strongest. Market share is high. Profit margins may be optimized. This creates a paradox: the moment of greatest apparent strength is often the moment of greatest strategic vulnerability.\n\nExample: Blockbuster was most profitable in 2004, just four years before bankruptcy.

The disruption comes from a steeper improvement trajectory and different performance dimensions that become more important over time.\n\nExample: Early digital cameras took terrible photos. They also didn't need film, developing, or photo stores. The performance dimension that mattered changed.\n\nKey Concepts and Terminology\n\nPhysical Limit: The fundamental constraint\u2014often rooted in physics, chemistry, or biology\u2014that caps a technology's improvement potential.

Occurs when performance exceeds customer needs.\n\nInflection Point: The transition from one phase of the S-curve to another. The shift from slow growth to rapid growth, or from rapid growth to maturity.\n\nTechnology Discontinuity: The jump from one S-curve to a fundamentally different one.

S-Curve Analysis would have shown: electronic word processing is on a steeper curve. The typing interface has reached its limits. The curve-jump is coming.\n\nWithout S-Curve Analysis: Leaders extrapolate current conditions.\n\nReason 2: It Identifies Investment Timing\n\nKnowing where you are on an S-curve determines how you should allocate resources. Early-stage technologies need patient capital and room to fail. Mature technologies need harvesting strategies. Transitional periods need hedged bets.\n\nExample: Shell Oil in the 1970s used S-curve thinking to recognize that easy oil was approaching limits. This drove their famous scenario planning work\u2014and their early investments in alternatives. They didn't abandon oil; they positioned for what came after.\n\nWithout S-Curve Analysis: Resources flow to wherever margins are currently highest\u2014which is often exactly where they shouldn't go.\n\nReason 3: It Reveals Innovation Opportunity Types\n\nDifferent positions on the S-curve create different innovation opportunities:\n\nEarly curve: Opportunities in feasibility demonstration and initial application discovery",

Multi-core architectures offered a new S-curve\u2014parallel processing rather than serial speed.\n\nIntel made a strategic bet: abandon the race for higher clock speeds and transition to multi-core processors. This required:\n\nRetraining their engineering organization around parallel architecture\n\nReeducating the market about performance metrics\n\nCoordinating with software developers to leverage multiple cores\n\nThe Key Insight:\n\nIntel recognized they were at the top of one S-curve and needed to jump to another before the market forced them. By making the transition proactively, they maintained leadership position despite the paradigm shift.\n\nThe Impact:\n\nIntel maintained market dominance through the transition. Their multi-core chips (Core 2 Duo, then Core i-series) defined the next era of computing. Competitors who tried to extend the single-core curve (primarily AMD at that point) fell behind.\n\nThe Lesson:\n\nProactive S-curve transitions preserve market position.

Kodak interpreted continued profits as continued health.\n\nThey underestimated the alternative curve slope: Digital imaging improved faster than they projected. By the time digital quality matched film for consumer purposes, Kodak was years behind competitors.\n\nThey failed to identify market limits: Consumers didn't need archival-quality images. \"Good enough\" digital plus instant preview plus easy sharing exceeded the market limit threshold long before digital matched film technically.\n\nThe Key Insight:",

Being positioned on the right curve at the right time matters more than being the biggest player on the incumbent curve.\n\nADVANCED CONCEPTS AND MENTAL MODELS\n\nMental Model 1: The Sailing Ship Effect\n\nWhen steamships first appeared, sailing ship builders didn't surrender\u2014they improved. Sailing ships got faster, more efficient, more sophisticated. This \"sailing ship effect\" is a predictable response to S-curve transitions: the incumbent technology accelerates improvement as a competitive response to the emerging alternative.\n\nApplication: Don't confuse a final flourish of incumbent improvement with a new S-curve. The sailing ships got better\u2014and then they disappeared entirely. Watch the slopes, not the latest data point.\n\nExample: When streaming emerged, cable companies dramatically improved their offerings\u2014on-demand, DVR, premium channels. This didn't change the fundamental S-curve dynamics. It merely created a final flourish before cord-cutting accelerated.\n\nMental Model 2: Performance Dimension Shifts\n\nS-curve transitions often involve not just a new technology but a new definition of performance. The disrupting technology wins not by beating the incumbent on current metrics but by changing which metrics matter.",

The disrupting technology wins not by beating the incumbent on current metrics but by changing which metrics matter.\n\nApplication: When analyzing alternatives, don't just ask \"Can it match current performance?\" Ask \"What new performance dimensions might become more important?\"\n\nExample: Digital photography initially couldn't match film quality. But digital introduced new performance dimensions\u2014instant preview, unlimited shots, easy sharing, no developing costs. These dimensions became more important than archival quality for most users.\n\nMental Model 3: Overlapping S-Curves and the Transition Window\n\nS-curves don't switch instantaneously. There's a window where the incumbent curve is flattening while the alternative curve is steepening. This \"transition window\" is where strategic choices matter most\u2014and where most organizations make their critical mistakes.\n\nApplication: Identify where you are in the transition window. Early in the window, the incumbent is still extractable. Late in the window, the die is cast. Mid-window is where proactive positioning pays off.\n\nExample: The smartphone transition window lasted roughly from 2005 (when smartphone improvement curves steepened) to 2010 (when the transition was unmistakable). Companies that positioned mid-window (Apple) captured the future. Companies that waited until late-window (BlackBerry) couldn't recover.",

Companies at the top of an S-curve frequently show strong financials\u2014high market share, optimized operations, peak profitability. But this is exactly when they're most vulnerable to being displaced by alternatives.\n\nApplication: Never confuse current financial performance with strategic health. The two can diverge dramatically at S-curve transitions.\n\nExample: Blockbuster was most profitable in 2004. MySpace was most trafficked in 2008. BlackBerry was most sold in 2011. In each case, strong current metrics masked declining strategic position.\n\nEdge Cases and Special Considerations\n\nMultiple Simultaneous Curves: Some industries face not one alternative S-curve but several. In energy storage: solid-state batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, sodium-ion, and others all represent different curves.

The relevant limit is whichever comes first.\n\nExample: Commercial aircraft speed could be increased significantly beyond current levels\u2014the physics allows it. But customers don't value speed enough to pay for faster flights. Airlines hit market limits, not physical limits.\n\nMISTAKE 3: Dismissing Alternatives That Currently Underperform\n\nThe Problem: Rejecting alternative technologies because they don't match incumbent performance today.\n\nThe Reality Check: The defining characteristic of disruptive S-curves is that they start underperforming. That's not a reason to dismiss them\u2014it's a reason to watch them carefully.\n\nThe Fix: Evaluate alternatives based on their trajectory, not their current position. A steeper curve that starts lower will eventually cross a flatter curve that starts higher.\n\nExample: Every major technology transition has followed this pattern. Early cars were slower than horses. Early digital cameras produced worse images than film. Early smartphones had worse voice quality than feature phones.\n\nMISTAKE 4: Assuming Transitions Happen When Curves Cross\n\nThe Problem: Expecting S-curve transitions to occur precisely when the alternative achieves performance parity with the incumbent.",

The transition happens when performance crosses AND adoption barriers are surmountable.\n\nExample: Electric vehicle performance crossed gasoline vehicle viability years ago for many use cases. But charging infrastructure, purchase price, and range anxiety created adoption barriers that delayed mass transition.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Extrapolating Linear Improvement\n\nThe Problem: Assuming that recent improvement rates will continue indefinitely. Drawing a straight line through recent data points.\n\nThe Reality Check: All S-curves flatten. Recent rapid improvement is evidence of being in the growth phase\u2014which is followed by maturity and flattening.\n\nThe Fix: When you see rapid improvement, ask: What limits will eventually constrain this? How far are we from those limits? Don't extrapolate\u2014diagnose position.\n\nExample: The famous failure of semiconductor industry predictions. Analysts repeatedly extrapolated Moore's Law linearly, ignoring the physical limits of miniaturization that eventually slowed improvement.",

The right strategy depends on your resources, capabilities, risk tolerance, and competitive position\u2014not just curve position.\n\nThe Fix: Use S-curve analysis to understand the situation, then apply strategic judgment. An incumbent at the top of the curve might harvest, might invest in alternatives, might acquire the alternative leader, or might exit the industry.\n\nExample: IBM was at the top of the mainframe S-curve when PCs emerged. They could have harvested mainframes and exited. Instead, they entered PCs (successfully initially), proving that curve position doesn't dictate a single strategy.\n\nMISTAKE 7: Ignoring the Sailing Ship Effect\n\nThe Problem: Confusing incumbent technology's competitive response with a new S-curve. When alternatives emerge, incumbents often accelerate improvement\u2014but this doesn't change the fundamental dynamics.\n\nThe Reality Check: A final flourish of improvement doesn't create a new curve.

Their x86 processor architecture had driven thirty years of growth, but the physics were becoming unforgiving. Clock speeds couldn't increase forever\u2014power consumption grew exponentially, heat dissipation became impossible, and the performance gains per dollar were flattening.",

Clock speeds couldn't increase forever\u2014power consumption grew exponentially, heat dissipation became impossible, and the performance gains per dollar were flattening.\n\nMany inside Intel wanted to keep optimizing. The x86 was their fortress, their moat, their identity. But the company's technology forecasters mapped the S-curve and saw the inflection point approaching. The question wasn't whether the limit would come, but when.\n\nIntel made a strategic choice: invest heavily in multi-core architectures before the old curve flatlined completely. They didn't wait until crisis forced the decision. They read the curve, saw the future, and jumped early enough to maintain leadership through the transition.\n\nThe result? Intel navigated a fundamental technology transition without losing market dominance. They were criticized by some for \"abandoning\" clock speed optimization too early\u2014but those critics were looking at the present. Intel was reading the curve.\n\nA Cautionary Tale: Kodak's Comfortable Blindness\n\nYou know this story, but you probably don't know it well enough.\n\nKodak didn't miss digital photography. They invented it. In 1975, Kodak engineer Steven Sasson created the first digital camera. Kodak held key patents.

Film resolution vastly exceeded digital sensors. Film cameras were cheaper. The workflow was established. By every metric that mattered to them, film was winning.\n\nWhat they failed to see was curve position. Digital was at the bottom of its S-curve\u2014the part where performance improves slowly and the technology looks weak. Film was at the top of its S-curve\u2014where performance is excellent but improvement has essentially stopped.\n\nThe defining characteristic of S-curves is that the technology at the bottom of a new curve eventually surpasses the one at the top of an old curve.

But \"performance\" means different things for different technologies and different users. CPU clock speed matters for some applications; power efficiency matters for others. You must identify which performance parameters are relevant to your strategic question.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe choice of performance parameters determines what your S-curve reveals. Choosing the wrong parameters is like mapping the wrong territory\u2014you'll have beautiful curves that tell you nothing useful. The best parameter choices are those that: (1) matter to users, (2) drive competitive advantage, and (3) have physical limits.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd WORKSHEET 1.2: Performance Parameter Identification\n\nInstructions: Identify 3-5 key performance parameters for your technology.

If the foundation is weak, the limit analysis will be meaningless.\n\nPHASE 2: LIMIT ANALYSIS\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Phase 2, you will identify and analyze the limits constraining your technology. This is the critical phase that separates useful S-curve analysis from superficial trend-following.\n\nEvery technology faces limits. Physical limits derive from nature\u2014you can't exceed the speed of light, you can't violate thermodynamics. Market limits derive from economics\u2014what customers will pay, what's \"good enough,\" what competing priorities exist. Competitive limits derive from industry dynamics\u2014what others are achieving, what's patented, what's accessible.\n\nUnderstanding limits is understanding fate. A technology approaching its physical limits has a predictable future: improvement will slow, then stop. A technology far from its limits has runway for continued advance. The strategic implications differ entirely.\n\nPhase 2 Objectives\n\nBy the end of this phase, you will have:\n\n[ ] Identified physical/theoretical limits for each parameter\n\n[ ] Quantified proximity to those limits\n\n[ ] Identified market limits (good enough thresholds)\n\n[ ] Identified competitive limits (what's achievable vs. what's reached)\n\n[ ] Calculated limit impact on remaining runway\n\n[ ] Prioritized which limits will bind first\n\nEstimated Time: 5-7 hours\n\nSTEP 2.1: Physical and Theoretical Limits",

There are fundamental limits\u2014speed of light, thermodynamic efficiency, atomic structure\u2014that cannot be exceeded regardless of ingenuity. There are also practical physical limits\u2014heat dissipation, material strength, quantum effects\u2014that constrain implementation even before theoretical limits.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nPhysical limits are the only truly hard limits.

This is where S-Curve Analysis becomes forward-looking\u2014moving from diagnosis to opportunity identification.\n\nThe key insight: Alternative technologies often appear weak by current metrics while being strong by different metrics. The technologies that replace incumbents rarely win on the incumbent's terms initially. They win by changing what matters.\n\nPhase 3 Objectives\n\nBy the end of this phase, you will have:\n\n[ ] Identified emerging alternative technologies\n\n[ ] Mapped alternatives on their own S-curves\n\n[ ] Assessed which alternatives could cross your curve\n\n[ ] Estimated crossing timelines\n\n[ ] Evaluated switching costs and barriers\n\n[ ] Prioritized alternatives by threat/opportunity level\n\nEstimated Time: 4-6 hours\n\nSTEP 3.1: Identify Emerging Alternatives\n\nWhat This Step Accomplishes\n\nBefore you can assess alternatives, you must find them. This step systematically scans for technologies that could substitute for or replace your focal technology.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe technologies that disrupt are often hiding in plain sight\u2014dismissed because they're \"too weak\" or \"too expensive\" or \"too niche.\" Systematic scanning catches what casual observation misses.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd WORKSHEET 3.1: Alternative Technology Identification\n\nPart A: Functional Alternatives\n\nWhat function does your technology perform?

They almost always decelerate as limits approach.\n\nMistake 5: Dismissing Early-Stage Alternatives\n\nWhat it looks like: \"That technology is too weak/expensive to matter\"\n\nWhy it happens: Current-state bias; comparing to your mature technology unfairly\n\nHow to fix it: Compare improvement rates, not current performance.

A small planning team in London, led by Pierre Wack, began questioning the industry's fundamental assumptions. They weren't doing conventional forecasting\u2014they were doing scenario planning. But underlying their scenarios was a crucial insight about technology and market S-curves.\n\nWhat made this situation particularly challenging:\n\nOverwhelming consensus: The entire industry agreed on the basic outlook. Challenging it seemed irrational.\n\nSuccess blindness: Oil majors were enormously profitable. Why question what was working?\n\nTechnical complexity: The interplay of geology, politics, economics, and technology was genuinely difficult to model.\n\nThe conventional approach would have been:\n\nExtrapolate existing trends. Assume OPEC continues selling at current prices. Plan for incremental demand growth. Invest in proven oil fields.\n\nWhy that would have failed:\n\nThe conventional approach treated oil markets as a continuous system. It missed that multiple S-curves were approaching limits simultaneously:\n\nEasy-to-extract oil reserves in the Middle East were peaking in production efficiency\n\nWestern demand was climbing the steep part of its adoption curve\n\nOPEC countries were moving up the learning curve on using oil as political leverage",

The easy gains were exhausted.\n\nWestern consumption: Demand was still climbing rapidly\u2014approaching the steep part of the adoption curve.\n\nOPEC political sophistication: Arab oil states were learning to coordinate. Their political capability was in its growth phase.\n\nAlternative energy: Nuclear, solar, and conservation technologies were in emergence but showing rapid improvement.\n\nThe key insight: Western consumption was climbing while OPEC's willingness to supply cheaply was approaching a limit. The curves were on collision course.\n\nStep 2: Identifying the Limits\n\nThe team identified several binding limits:\n\nPhysical limits: Spare production capacity was being exhausted.\n\nPolitical limits: OPEC countries had less and less incentive to maintain low prices as their economies developed.\n\nMarket limits: Western consumers had no immediate alternatives.

S-curve transitions often are. The world could shift from one regime to another quickly.\n\nThe Pivotal Moment:\n\nIn 1972, Shell presented scenarios to management that included oil prices quadrupling. Most executives initially dismissed this as fantasy. But the analysis was rigorous. The S-curves pointed to instability in the existing system.\n\nWhen the 1973 oil crisis hit\u2014triggered by the Yom Kippur War but fundamentally caused by the underlying dynamics Shell had identified\u2014Shell was prepared. Other oil majors were not.\n\nTHE OUTCOME\n\nQuantified Results:\n\nQualitative Impact:\n\nShell's scenario planning became legendary in business strategy. The company's approach to uncertainty\u2014grounded in understanding technology and market trajectories\u2014became a model for strategic planning globally.\n\nMore importantly, Shell didn't just survive the oil crises; they emerged stronger.

Shell anticipated the limit; competitors experienced the discontinuity.\n\nIf You Only Remember One Thing:\n\nS-curve analysis isn't about predicting the future\u2014it's about understanding which futures are possible and which constraints are approaching.

Kodak held key patents. The company had research capabilities, brand recognition, distribution networks, and customer relationships that any competitor would envy. By every conventional measure, Kodak was positioned to dominate digital photography.\n\nInstead, Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nThis isn't a story about missing a technological shift. Kodak SAW the shift coming. They CREATED the technology that would destroy them. The failure was in S-curve analysis\u2014specifically, in how Kodak interpreted what the curves were telling them.\n\nWhat made this situation particularly challenging:\n\nFilm was extremely profitable: Kodak's film business generated margins exceeding 60%. Digital would cannibalize this.\n\nDigital was genuinely inferior: In 1990, digital resolution, color accuracy, and workflow were objectively worse than film.\n\nNetwork effects favored film: Photo labs, retailers, and consumers were all invested in film-based systems.\n\nThe conventional approach would have been:",

The conventional approach looked at current performance (film wins) instead of trajectory (digital was improving 40%+ annually while film improved incrementally).\n\nTHE APPLICATION (What Kodak Should Have Done)\n\nWhat S-Curve Analysis Would Have Revealed:\n\nStep 1: Map Positions on Respective Curves\n\nFilm technology: Near the top of its S-curve. Silver halide chemistry was mature. Resolution improvements were marginal. Manufacturing efficiency was optimized.\n\nDigital imaging: At the bottom of its S-curve. CCD/CMOS sensors were primitive. But improvement rates were exponential\u2014following semiconductor scaling laws.\n\nStep 2: Identify Limits\n\nFilm limits: Grain structure imposed theoretical resolution limits. Chemical processing couldn't get much faster. Manufacturing costs had limited reduction potential.\n\nDigital limits: Semiconductor physics allowed enormous headroom. Storage costs following Moore's Law. Processing power following Moore's Law.\n\nStep 3: Calculate Crossing\n\nA rigorous analysis in 1990 would have shown:\n\nDigital resolution improving ~40% annually",

They had more data than anyone. But having data isn't the same as doing S-curve analysis. They never rigorously mapped the trajectories.\n\nCurrent-state bias kills: Evaluating technologies by current performance rather than improvement trajectory is the cardinal sin of S-curve analysis. Digital was \"worse\" in 1995; it was clearly going to be \"better\" by 2005.\n\nCrossing points are strategy points: The moment you can identify a crossing point, you face a strategic choice: lead the transition or be destroyed by it. Kodak waited until crossing to react\u2014far too late.\n\nIf You Only Remember One Thing:\n\nThe most dangerous place on an S-curve is at the top\u2014where you're successful, profitable, and feel most confident. That's exactly when a new curve is growing below you, preparing to cross.\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nIf you were a Kodak executive in 1990 with S-curve analysis showing digital would cross by 2003, what would you have done?\n\nWhy is it psychologically difficult to cannibalize a profitable product line even when analysis says you should?\n\nWhat companies today might be in Kodak's position\u2014dominant in a mature S-curve with a faster curve rising below?",

Engineers, software developers, and consumers all measured processor performance by clock speed.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Intel's technical leaders saw a problem: the clock speed S-curve was approaching physical limits. Power consumption increased roughly with the cube of frequency. Heat dissipation was becoming impossible. The Pentium 4 architecture, designed for clock speed, was hitting thermal walls.\n\nThe question wasn't whether the limit would come\u2014the physics was clear. The question was what to do about it.\n\nWhat made this situation particularly challenging:\n\nClock speed was Intel's brand: \"Intel Inside\" meant \"faster megahertz.\" Abandoning clock speed felt like abandoning identity.\n\nSoftware wasn't ready: Applications weren't written for multi-core. Jumping to multi-core meant software couldn't fully use the capability.\n\nAMD was attacking: AMD's Athlon chips were competitive on clock speed. A strategic pivot during competitive battle is risky.\n\nTHE APPLICATION\n\nStep 1: Map the S-Curve Position\n\nIntel's engineers mapped clock speed trajectory rigorously:\n\nHistorical improvement: ~50% annually for two decades\n\nCurrent position: 2-3 GHz\n\nProjected position: 4+ GHz by 2005\n\nPhysical limit: Power density approaching 100W/cm\u00b2 (unmanageable)\n\nThe S-curve position was clear: late maturity, approaching physical limits.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Binding Limit",

They were mature, reliable, and well-understood. Transistors were finicky, expensive, and limited in power handling.\n\nS-Curve Dynamic: Vacuum tubes were at the top of their S-curve. Transistors were at the bottom of a new curve with enormous runway (semiconductor scaling laws).\n\nResult: By 1965, transistors dominated. By 1975, vacuum tubes were relegated to niche applications. Companies that stayed with tubes (like RCA's TV division) lost to companies that rode the transistor curve (Texas Instruments, later Intel).\n\nKey Lesson: A mature technology with excellent current performance will be overtaken by an emerging technology with higher improvement rate.\n\nMINI-CASE B: Hard Drives vs. Solid State\n\nContext: In 2005, hard disk drives offered 10-100x the storage per dollar compared to solid-state drives. HDD manufacturers dismissed SSD as a niche product for military and aerospace.\n\nS-Curve Dynamic: HDDs were approaching mechanical limits (platter density, read/write head positioning).

Steam was expensive, unreliable, and required coal. Sailing ship owners invested MORE in optimization\u2014faster hulls, better rigging\u2014in response to steam's emergence.\n\nS-Curve Dynamic: Sailing ships were at the top of their curve with no improvement runway.

But applying it to technology strategy was a 20th-century development.\n\nThe Key Figure: Everett Rogers\n\nIn 1962, sociologist Everett Rogers published Diffusion of Innovations, codifying the S-curve of adoption. His work showed that new technologies spread through populations following a predictable pattern: innovators \u2192 early adopters \u2192 early majority \u2192 late majority \u2192 laggards. The cumulative adoption curve is an S.\n\nThe Business Application: Richard Foster\n\nWhile Rogers described adoption, Richard Foster (McKinsey) in the 1980s applied S-curve thinking to technology PERFORMANCE. His insight: each technology has a performance trajectory that follows an S-shape, and that trajectory has limits. When limits approach, new technologies can overtake incumbents.\n\nThe Organizational Dimension: Clayton Christensen\n\nChristensen's work in the 1990s explained why companies fail at S-curve transitions even when they see them coming. He showed that organizational dynamics\u2014customer relationships, profit models, capabilities\u2014trap incumbents on the old curve.\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nRichard N.

Not in some distant future you can comfortably ignore. But within a timeframe that will catch you flat-footed if you're not paying attention.\n\nThe answer isn't \"stay competitive\"\u2014that's too vague to be useful. It's not \"innovate more\"\u2014that's what everyone says. And it's certainly not \"watch the market\"\u2014everyone watches the market, yet most still get blindsided.\n\nThe answer is: Learn to recognize when a dominant design is falling apart.\n\nA dominant design is the fundamental architecture\u2014political, economic, social, or technological\u2014that an entire industry has collectively adopted because it solves multiple problems simultaneously. It's the QWERTY keyboard. The internal combustion engine. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The semester-based university calendar.\n\nThese aren't just products or practices. They're the invisible agreements that structure entire industries. They determine who wins, who loses, what's possible, and what's unthinkable. And here's what most people miss: they don't last forever.",

The very efficiencies it enables create rigidities. The very problems it solves make practitioners forget that other problems exist.\n\nThis is Dominant Designs Analysis\u2014the systematic practice of identifying when the rules of competition are about to change, and positioning yourself to benefit from the transformation rather than be destroyed by it.\n\nMost innovators miss this. They focus on improving existing products within the current rules. They compete harder at the game everyone else is playing. They're like chess masters perfecting their strategy while the world is shifting to a different game entirely.\n\nThe opportunity isn't in playing the current game better. The opportunity is in recognizing when the game itself is changing.\n\nTHE PROBLEM WITH CONVENTIONAL COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS\n\nLet me tell you why most competitive strategy fails spectacularly at the moments that matter most.\n\nConsider a typical strategic planning session. The team gathers. They analyze competitors. They benchmark best practices. They identify market trends. They create elaborate spreadsheets projecting market share, pricing scenarios, and growth trajectories.",

They create elaborate spreadsheets projecting market share, pricing scenarios, and growth trajectories.\n\nAnd almost all of this analysis assumes one crucial thing: that the fundamental structure of the industry will remain stable.\n\nThe spreadsheets assume customers will continue wanting roughly the same things. The competitive analysis assumes the same players will remain relevant. The trend analysis assumes current trajectories will continue. The strategy assumes the rules of competition will persist.\n\nThis is what I call presentism\u2014the dangerous assumption that the future is simply an extension of the present. It's not a failure of intelligence. It's a failure of imagination. And it's built into virtually every tool of conventional business analysis.\n\nThe Kodak Paradox\n\nConsider Eastman Kodak. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kodak was the gold standard of corporate excellence. They had extraordinary market share, massive R&D capabilities, and brilliant strategic planning processes. They benchmarked relentlessly. They understood their customers deeply. They improved their products continuously.\n\nThey also invented the digital camera.\n\nYes, Kodak invented the very technology that would destroy them. In 1975, Steve Sasson, a Kodak engineer, created the first digital camera prototype. Company executives looked at it and said, essentially: \"That's interesting. But film is our business.\"",

Film was profitable, improving, and had an established ecosystem. By every conventional metric, doubling down on film was the smart move.\n\nWhat they missed was that digital photography wasn't just another product improvement. It was a new dominant design\u2014a fundamentally different architecture for capturing and sharing images. And once that architecture reached a certain threshold of capability and affordability, all of Kodak's advantages in the old system became irrelevant.\n\nThe film processing infrastructure? Worthless. The chemical expertise? Unneeded. The retail partnerships? Bypassed. The customer relationships built on a yearly cycle of vacation photos? Replaced by instant sharing.\n\nKodak didn't fail because they weren't competitive. They failed because they were competing brilliantly in a game that was ending.\n\nThe Gap That Dominant Designs Analysis Fills\n\nThis is the gap that conventional competitive analysis cannot fill. It can tell you how to compete within the current structure. It cannot tell you when the structure itself is about to shift.\n\nDominant Designs Analysis addresses this gap directly.

They supplement it with something equally essential: the ability to recognize when the rules are about to change.\n\nWHERE THIS THINKING COMES FROM\n\nThe Intellectual Foundation\n\nThe concept of dominant designs emerged from the study of technological evolution\u2014specifically, from researchers trying to understand why certain technologies win out over alternatives and what happens when they're eventually displaced.\n\nThe intellectual roots trace back to the intersection of evolutionary economics, the sociology of technology, and innovation studies. Researchers observed that technological competition doesn't follow smooth curves of improvement. Instead, it exhibits punctuated patterns: long periods of incremental improvement within established architectures, interrupted by sudden shifts to entirely new architectures.",

It had structure. And understanding that structure could help practitioners anticipate and prepare for transitions.\n\nThe Key Thinkers\n\nWilliam Abernathy and James Utterback laid the groundwork in the 1970s with their research on innovation patterns in the automobile and other industries. They observed that industries go through distinct phases: an early \"fluid\" phase where many competing designs exist, followed by the emergence of a dominant design, followed by a long period of incremental improvement focused on that design.\n\nTheir crucial insight was that once a dominant design emerges, the nature of competition changes fundamentally. Before the dominant design, companies compete on product architecture\u2014on finding the best overall design. After the dominant design, companies compete on execution\u2014on implementing the established design more efficiently, more reliably, more affordably.",

These eras, they showed, are when the greatest opportunities and risks exist.\n\nClayton Christensen added another crucial dimension with his research on disruptive innovation. He showed that dominant designs are often displaced not by superior technology, but by \"good enough\" technology that serves overlooked market segments or enables new business models. The disruption comes from the margins, not from direct competition.\n\nAndy Grove, the legendary Intel CEO, brought these academic insights into practical application with his concept of \"strategic inflection points\"\u2014moments when the fundamentals of a business shift and companies must adapt or die.

They have predictable precursors. They follow recognizable patterns. And they create predictable opportunities for those who can read the signs.\n\nThe precursors include:\n\nUser complaints that incumbents dismiss as unreasonable or uninformed\n\nFringe experiments that established players consider irrelevant or impractical\n\nInfluential early adopters who embrace alternatives despite their limitations\n\nEmerging technologies that could eventually solve problems the current design cannot address\n\nBusiness model innovations that change the economics of the industry\n\nBy systematically scanning for these precursors, innovators can identify dominant design transitions before they become obvious\u2014and position themselves to benefit from the transformation.\n\nWhy the Foundation Matters\n\nUnderstanding where this thinking comes from isn't merely academic exercise.

It provides crucial context for applying the tool effectively.\n\nFirst, it reminds us that dominant design analysis is not speculation or prediction. It's based on observable patterns that have repeated across industries and time periods. The patterns are robust because they reflect fundamental dynamics of technological and market evolution.\n\nSecond, it provides frameworks for distinguishing genuine dominant design shifts from ordinary competitive dynamics. Not every new technology represents a dominant design transition. Not every startup represents disruption. The intellectual foundation helps us separate signal from noise.\n\nThird, it connects dominant design analysis to a broader ecosystem of innovation tools. Scenario planning, trend analysis, disruptive innovation theory\u2014these are all related approaches that address different aspects of the same fundamental challenge: anticipating and preparing for structural change.\n\nTHE DOMINANT DESIGNS FRAMEWORK\n\nWhat We Mean By Dominant Design\n\nA dominant design is a fundamental architecture that industry players collectively adopt because it solves multiple problems simultaneously, balancing practicality, cost, and user acceptance.\n\nThis definition has several crucial elements worth unpacking:",

The IBM PC architecture wasn't a specific computer; it was a standardized way of organizing processor, memory, storage, display, and input components that enabled an entire ecosystem.\n\n\"Industry players collectively adopt\" means dominant designs are social phenomena, not just technological ones. A dominant design emerges when multiple companies, suppliers, customers, regulators, and complementors align around a common approach. This alignment creates powerful network effects and switching costs that reinforce the dominant design's position.\n\n\"Solves multiple problems simultaneously\" means dominant designs win not because they're optimal for any single criterion, but because they represent workable compromises across many competing demands.

A technically superior design that's too expensive or too difficult to adopt won't become dominant. Neither will an affordable, easy-to-use design that doesn't actually solve the underlying problem.\n\nThe Three Core Principles\n\nPrinciple 1: Dominant Designs Are Temporary\n\nEvery dominant design eventually faces obsolescence. The very features that made it successful create blind spots. The compromises that enabled wide adoption also limit what's possible. The ecosystem that reinforces it also makes it rigid.\n\nThe internal combustion engine was a brilliant solution for personal transportation in the 20th century. But the infrastructure and expertise built around it also created resistance to alternatives.

This creates powerful incentives to defend the existing architecture rather than embrace alternatives.\n\nExample: The incandescent light bulb dominated for over a century. It was cheap to manufacture, well-understood, supported by massive infrastructure. But it converted only 5% of electricity to light, with 95% wasted as heat. LED technology, initially expensive and limited in applications, eventually became good enough on the dimensions that mattered while being dramatically superior on energy efficiency. The dominant design that seemed eternal fell in less than two decades.\n\nPrinciple 2: Transitions Follow Recognizable Patterns\n\nDominant design transitions don't happen overnight or randomly. They follow an observable sequence:\n\nEra of Incremental Improvement: The dominant design is stable. Competition focuses on efficiency, cost reduction, and minor feature improvements. Incumbents thrive.\n\nEmergence of Signals: User frustrations accumulate. Fringe experiments appear. Adjacent technologies mature. Early adopters begin exploring alternatives. Most industry participants dismiss these signals.\n\nEra of Ferment: Multiple alternatives compete. Uncertainty is high. Some incumbents experiment while others defend the status quo. New entrants arrive. The industry becomes chaotic.",

The industry becomes chaotic.\n\nNew Dominant Design Emerges: One architecture wins out (not necessarily the technically best one). Competition shifts back to execution. A new period of incremental improvement begins.\n\nExample: The transition from film to digital photography followed this pattern precisely. Through the 1990s, film photography improved incrementally while digital cameras remained expensive curiosities. By the early 2000s, digital cameras had become \"good enough\" for casual photography, and an era of ferment began. Multiple digital formats competed. Camera manufacturers scrambled to adapt. By the late 2000s, the smartphone camera emerged as the new dominant design, and a new era of incremental improvement began\u2014this time focused on computational photography, AI enhancement, and social sharing.\n\nPrinciple 3: Opportunities Concentrate at Transition Points\n\nThe greatest opportunities for innovation and market entry exist during the era of ferment\u2014after the old dominant design begins weakening but before the new one is established.\n\nDuring stable periods, incumbents have overwhelming advantages: established customer relationships, optimized processes, accumulated expertise, ecosystem control.

Competing with them directly is extremely difficult.\n\nDuring transitions, these advantages become liabilities. Established customer relationships may be with the wrong customers. Optimized processes may produce the wrong outputs. Accumulated expertise may be in declining skills. Ecosystem control may lock companies into dying architectures.\n\nExample: When Netflix began streaming video, established video rental chains had enormous advantages: prime real estate locations, customer databases, efficient logistics systems. But these advantages were optimized for physical distribution. As the dominant design shifted to streaming, Blockbuster's store locations became expensive liabilities, their logistics expertise became irrelevant, and their customer relationships couldn't transfer to a digital model. Netflix's \"disadvantage\" of having no physical infrastructure became an advantage\u2014they had nothing to defend and everything to gain.\n\nKey Concepts and Terminology\n\nEra of Ferment: A chaotic period when multiple new ideas compete for dominance after an established design begins to falter.

Not all innovations are discontinuities; most are incremental improvements within the existing architecture.\n\nNetwork Effects: The phenomenon where a design becomes more valuable as more users adopt it, contributing to its dominance. Network effects can protect dominant designs far past their technical superiority\u2014but they can also accelerate transitions once a tipping point is reached.\n\nSwitching Costs: The expenses and effort required to change from one design to another. High switching costs often maintain dominant designs' position even when alternatives are technically superior.\n\nInflection Point: The moment when a dominant design begins showing signs of weakness through user complaints, fringe experiments, or influential endorsements. Recognizing inflection points early is the key skill in dominant designs analysis.\n\nMarket Saturation: The point where a dominant design meets or exceeds typical user needs, creating opportunity for alternative solutions that may be \"worse\" on traditional metrics but better on overlooked dimensions.",

The most dangerous assumption in strategy is that tomorrow will look like today.\n\nWhy It Works: The Mechanism\n\nDominant designs analysis works because it addresses a fundamental asymmetry in how organizations perceive change.\n\nEstablished organizations are highly attuned to competitive dynamics within the current structure. They track market share shifts, monitor competitor moves, and respond to price changes. Their information systems, incentive structures, and strategic planning processes are all designed to compete effectively within the existing game.\n\nBut these same systems are poorly designed to detect structural change. Market share data doesn't reveal when the market itself is becoming irrelevant. Competitor analysis doesn't capture threats from adjacent industries or new business models. Customer feedback tends to focus on improvements within the current paradigm rather than identifying when the paradigm itself is becoming obsolete.\n\nDominant designs analysis provides a systematic approach to detecting structural change by focusing specifically on the precursors of dominant design transitions:",

Making these assumptions explicit enables examination of whether they still hold.\n\nWhat user frustrations are being dismissed? The complaints that incumbents dismiss as unreasonable or uninformed often reveal limitations of the current dominant design. When users consistently want something the current design cannot provide, a transition may be approaching.\n\nWhat experiments are happening on the margins? Fringe experiments that established players consider irrelevant often contain the seeds of future dominant designs. Paying attention to what's being tried\u2014not just what's succeeding\u2014provides early warning.\n\nWhat enabling conditions are changing?

Companies compete to make the existing solution cheaper, faster, more reliable. These opportunities are real, but they're also visible to everyone. Competition is fierce, margins are compressed, and truly differentiated positions are rare.\n\nThe hidden opportunities exist at the boundaries:\n\nServing users who don't fit the dominant design well.

The automobile solved transportation but created parking problems, traffic congestion, pollution. Each created problem is a potential opportunity.\n\nPreparing for the next dominant design. When transition signals appear, early positioning in potential new architectures creates option value. Even uncertain bets on future architectures can be highly valuable if the transition materializes.\n\nExample: Southwest Airlines didn't compete directly with major carriers on the dominant design of hub-and-spoke networks with full service. Instead, they served the underserved segment of price-sensitive travelers with point-to-point flights and no-frills service. This wasn't a temporary competitive position\u2014it was an alternative architecture that eventually became its own dominant design for short-haul travel.\n\nWithout this: Companies become trapped competing for incremental improvements within crowded markets, missing the structural opportunities that create breakthrough returns.\n\nReason 2: It Provides Strategic Early Warning\n\nDominant designs analysis provides early warning of industry transitions\u2014often years or decades before they become obvious to conventional analysis.",

When everyone recognizes that an industry is in transition, entry barriers are low (everyone is scrambling), uncertainty is maximum (no one knows what's next), and competitive pressure is intense (many players are chasing the same opportunities).\n\nWhen you recognize a transition early, you can:\n\nBuild capabilities before they're in demand. The skills, relationships, and infrastructure needed for a new dominant design take time to develop. Early recognition enables early investment.\n\nAcquire positions while they're undervalued.

By the time the transition became obvious, AWS had an insurmountable lead.\n\nWithout this: Companies react to transitions after they're obvious, competing with many others for the same late-stage opportunities, often with inadequate capabilities and at maximum prices.\n\nReason 3: It Prevents Defensive Traps\n\nOne of the most dangerous responses to an emerging dominant design transition is to defend the existing architecture rather than embrace the new one.\n\nThis defensive response is psychologically natural and often economically rational in the short term. Existing architectures represent massive investments. Companies have built capabilities, relationships, and processes optimized for the current design.

Customer relationships built on the old value proposition may not transfer to new offerings. Perhaps most importantly, the organizational culture becomes oriented toward preservation rather than innovation.\n\nDominant designs analysis helps prevent defensive traps by:\n\nMaking transitions visible earlier. When transitions are distant and uncertain, the costs of defensive responses are low. When transitions are immediate and obvious, the costs of switching are high. Early visibility enables earlier, less costly transitions.\n\nFraming transitions as opportunities rather than threats.

Their Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips were their flagship product, and the company had built its identity, capabilities, and relationships around memory chip design and manufacturing.\n\nBut the memory chip market was transforming. Japanese manufacturers had entered with massive government support, superior quality control, and a willingness to compete on price that Intel couldn't match. Intel's market share was collapsing. Losses were mounting. The company that had pioneered the memory chip market was being driven out of it.\n\nWhat made this situation particularly challenging:",

Grove recognized that:\n\nThe memory chip dominant design was being commoditized.

This capability was more valuable in microprocessors than in commoditized memory chips. The transition wasn't about abandoning Intel's strengths; it was about applying those strengths to a more valuable architecture.\n\nThe Impact:\n\nIntel became synonymous with microprocessors, achieving near-monopoly positions in PC and server processors that persisted for decades.\n\nThe Lesson:\n\nDominant design transitions create opportunities to redefine competitive position. Intel's capabilities didn't change\u2014but their application did. By recognizing the transition and repositioning accordingly, Intel transformed from a declining commodity supplier to an industry-defining monopolist.\n\nCase Study 2: Encyclopedia Britannica \u2014 Failure\n\nThe Challenge:\n\nFor over two centuries, Encyclopedia Britannica was the gold standard of knowledge compilation.

Their sales force was legendary, their brand was impeccable, and their competitive position seemed unassailable.\n\nWithin a decade, the company had collapsed. Revenues fell by over 80%.

Netflix entered with an alternative architecture: DVD-by-mail with no late fees, queue-based selection, monthly subscription.\n\nThis wasn't just a different product\u2014it was a different architecture for video rental. No stores meant lower costs but delayed gratification. No late fees changed the consumption pattern.

But Reed Hastings recognized that streaming represented a new dominant design\u2014instant access, unlimited consumption, device flexibility.

Early performance improvements are slow as the design is being refined. Middle-stage improvements are rapid as the design is optimized. Late-stage improvements are slow again as the design approaches fundamental limits.\n\nApplication: Track where the current dominant design is on its S-curve. Slow improvement late in the curve suggests the design is approaching limits and transition may be near. Rapid improvement in the middle of the curve suggests the design is healthy and transition is less imminent.\n\nExample: Smartphone camera improvement followed a classic S-curve. Early cameras improved slowly (2-5 megapixels). Middle-stage improvements were rapid (better sensors, multiple lenses, computational photography). Current improvements are slowing\u2014cameras are \"good enough\" for most users, suggesting the architecture may be approaching maturity.\n\nMental Model 2: Overshooting and Underserved Segments\n\nAs dominant designs mature, they often overshoot the needs of mainstream customers while continuing to underserve specific segments.

This created openings for simpler alternatives (Basecamp vs. Microsoft Project, Slack vs. Lotus Notes) that traded features for usability.\n\nMental Model 3: The Sailing Ship Effect\n\nWhen new technologies threaten established ones, incumbents often respond with accelerated improvement of the old technology. This can create a temporary period where the old technology improves faster than it ever did before\u2014even as it's being displaced.\n\nApplication: Don't be fooled by accelerated improvement in the old design.

Film photography quality reached new heights after digital cameras emerged. These improvements, far from preventing transition, were signs of industries in decline.\n\nMental Model 4: Architectural Knowledge vs. Component Knowledge\n\nCompanies develop two types of knowledge: component knowledge (how to make specific parts better) and architectural knowledge (how parts fit together). Dominant design transitions often preserve component knowledge while destroying architectural knowledge.\n\nApplication: Inventory your knowledge portfolio. Which knowledge is component-level and therefore potentially transferable? Which is architectural-level and therefore at risk in a transition? This helps identify what capabilities might transfer to a new dominant design.\n\nExample: Kodak had world-class component knowledge in imaging sensors\u2014transferable to digital photography.

These windows eventually close as a new dominant design consolidates.\n\nApplication: Assess where you are in the transition timeline. Early positioning requires accepting higher uncertainty but offers the possibility of shaping the new architecture. Late positioning offers more certainty but less ability to influence outcomes.\n\nExample: The window for electric vehicle manufacturers to establish position is closing. Early entrants like Tesla shaped the emerging architecture (charging networks, software-defined vehicles, direct sales). Late entrants must accept that architecture rather than shape it.\n\nEdge Cases and Special Considerations\n\nMultiple Competing Designs: Sometimes no clear dominant design emerges. Multiple architectures coexist, each serving different segments. This creates sustained opportunity but also sustained uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory Preservation: Some dominant designs persist not because they're optimal but because regulations protect them.

Dominant Designs Analysis helps identify which un-defined problems might become ill-defined or well-defined as the new architecture emerges.\n\nWhy this alignment: Dominant design transitions create the kind of structured uncertainty that characterizes ill-defined problems.

The shift from feature phones to smartphones was a dominant design transition.\n\nMISTAKE 2: Overestimating Transition Speed\n\nThe Problem: Assuming transitions will happen faster than they actually do. Early signals of transition often appear years or decades before the transition materializes.\n\nThe Reality Check: Dominant design transitions require not just technological possibility but also infrastructure development, ecosystem formation, regulatory accommodation, and behavioral change. These take time.\n\nThe Fix: Explicitly assess the enabling conditions for transition. What infrastructure must be built? What regulations must change? What behaviors must shift? Time your positioning to match realistic transition timelines.\n\nExample: Electric vehicles were \"imminent\" for decades before the transition actually accelerated. Only when battery costs, charging infrastructure, and consumer acceptance reached critical thresholds did the transition materialize.\n\nMISTAKE 3: Applying Old Metrics to New Designs",

This makes alternatives look inadequate on dimensions they're not trying to compete on.\n\nThe Reality Check: New dominant designs often succeed by prioritizing different dimensions than current ones. Digital cameras initially had worse image quality than film but offered instant review and sharing. Streaming initially had worse selection than DVD rental but offered instant access.\n\nThe Fix: Identify what dimensions the alternative is optimizing for. Evaluate it on those dimensions, not on the dimensions the current design optimizes for.\n\nExample: MOOCs looked inadequate compared to university education on completion rates and depth of instruction. But they optimized for accessibility and cost\u2014dimensions traditional education wasn't addressing.\n\nMISTAKE 4: Waiting for Certainty\n\nThe Problem: Delaying action until the new dominant design is clear.

Waiting for certainty means accepting the positions established by others.\n\nThe Fix: Develop a portfolio of experiments across multiple potential architectures. Accept uncertainty about which will win while building capabilities and positions that provide optionality.\n\nExample: Companies that waited until streaming clearly dominated to invest in streaming capabilities found themselves far behind Netflix. The time to invest was during uncertainty, not after resolution.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Defending Rather Than Transitioning\n\nThe Problem: Responding to dominant design transitions by defending the existing architecture rather than building capabilities in the new one.\n\nThe Reality Check: Defensive responses rarely succeed because they divert resources from building new capabilities while the transition continues regardless.\n\nThe Fix: Allocate resources to new architecture development even while maintaining existing business. Cannibalize yourself before competitors do. Accept that existing advantages may become liabilities.\n\nExample: Kodak's defensive response\u2014continuing to invest in film while half-heartedly exploring digital\u2014accelerated their decline.

They start by serving segments or use cases the current design doesn't address well. By the time they're good enough for mainstream applications, the transition is well underway.\n\nThe Fix: Systematically scan for marginal experiments. Ask what they're optimizing for and who they're serving. Track their improvement trajectories.

They're embedded in ecosystems of related players whose positions also change during transitions. Ecosystem dynamics can accelerate or delay transitions.\n\nThe Fix: Map the ecosystem around the current dominant design. Identify which players benefit from the current architecture and which would benefit from alternatives. Consider how ecosystem dynamics affect transition timing and direction.\n\nExample: The smartphone transition accelerated because app developers, telecom carriers, and accessory makers all benefited from the new architecture. Electric vehicle transition depends on charging infrastructure, service networks, and electrical grid capacity.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE DOMINANT DESIGNS QUESTION\n\nThere's one question that separates those who truly understand Dominant Designs Analysis from those who merely go through the motions:\n\n\"What assumptions underlying our industry's current architecture are we failing to question\u2014and who is building an alternative?\"\n\nThis question demands uncomfortable honesty.

They play defense. They try to protect what they have.\n\nThis is exactly backward.\n\nEvery macro-change that destroys something also creates something. The same forces that bankrupted Blockbuster made Netflix a $200 billion company. The same regulatory shifts that crippled taxi monopolies enabled Uber to capture $100 billion in value. The same social changes that emptied shopping malls created a logistics empire for Amazon.\n\nThe question isn't whether massive changes are coming to your industry. They are. The question is whether you will be the destroyer or the destroyed.\n\nThis is Macro-Changes\u2014a systematic method for identifying the political, economic, social, and technological forces that are actively dismantling current paradigms, and finding the problems worth solving in what remains.\n\nMost innovators wait until disruption arrives.

They see trends clearly enough: e-commerce is growing, smartphones are emerging, social media is taking off. They commission a beautiful PowerPoint about \"digital transformation.\" They nod thoughtfully in strategy meetings.\n\nAnd then they watch their company collapse.\n\nThe problem wasn't that they didn't see the trends. The problem was that they treated trends as information to be monitored rather than forces to be exploited.\n\nConventional trend analysis asks: \"What is happening?\"\n\nMacro-Changes analysis asks: \"What is being destroyed, and what opportunities does that destruction create?\"\n\nThe Incremental Improvement Disease\n\nMost companies respond to macro-changes incrementally. A bookstore sees Amazon growing, so they improve their inventory management. A newspaper sees digital media rising, so they create a website. A taxi company sees ride-sharing emerging, so they build an app.\n\nThese are all reasonable responses. They're also completely inadequate.\n\nWhen macro-forces are at work, incremental improvement is a slow path to irrelevance.",

A financial services company tracks economic indicators\u2014and fails to anticipate political backlash against their industry.\n\nMacro-changes don't happen in silos.

The innovators who win are using Macro-Changes analysis as Gibson intended: as a lens for seeing problems worth solving before they become obvious.\n\nTHE MACRO-CHANGES FRAMEWORK\n\nWhat We Mean By Macro-Changes\n\nA macro-change is a large-scale shift in the Political, Economic, Social, or Technological environment that has the power to:\n\nDestroy existing business models, products, or services\n\nCreate new problems that didn't exist before\n\nShift value from incumbents to new entrants\n\nRedefine what customers need and want\n\nNot all changes qualify as macro-changes. A new competitor entering your market is a competitive threat, but it's not a macro-change. A technology that fundamentally alters how your industry operates is a macro-change.\n\nThe test: Would this change affect multiple industries, multiple geographies, or multiple customer segments? If yes, it's probably a macro-change.\n\nThe PEST Framework\n\nPEST analysis provides a structured way to identify and categorize macro-changes:\n\nPOLITICAL\n\nRegulatory changes (new laws, enforcement shifts)\n\nGovernment policy (subsidies, taxes, trade agreements)",

It creates entirely new problem spaces.\n\nWhen smartphones destroyed the camera industry, they created:\n\nThe need for mobile-first photo management\n\nThe opportunity for social photo sharing\n\nThe demand for mobile photography accessories\n\nThe market for photo-based communication apps\n\nInstagram, Snapchat, and GoPro all emerged from the destruction of Kodak's business model.\n\nYour job is to identify what's being destroyed and find the problems worth solving in the aftermath.\n\nPrinciple 2: Forces Interact and Compound\n\nMacro-changes rarely operate in isolation. A technological change creates economic shifts which trigger political responses which alter social behavior.\n\nConsider electric vehicles:\n\nTechnological: Battery costs dropping, charging infrastructure improving\n\nPolitical: Government mandates, emissions regulations, subsidies\n\nEconomic: Lower operating costs, new financing models, grid infrastructure investment\n\nSocial: Environmental consciousness, status signaling, range anxiety acceptance\n\nAnalyzing any single dimension gives an incomplete picture.

There's a continuum of strategic positions:\n\nPure Destroyer: Accelerates the destruction (short sellers, disruptors, activists)\n\nDestroyer-Builder: Profits from destruction while building alternatives (Tesla destroys ICE while building EVs)\n\nBridge Builder: Helps incumbents transition (digital transformation consultants)\n\nPure Builder: Creates new value enabled by destruction (Zoom didn't destroy anything\u2014it built on destruction of co-location assumptions)\n\nApplication: Choose your position consciously.

Opportunity space is large.\n\nWHERE MACRO-CHANGES FITS IN PWS METHODOLOGY\n\nWeek 3 Position and Rationale\n\nMacro-Changes is taught in Week 3 of the Problems Worth Solving curriculum, positioned within the Ill-defined Problems module.\n\nWhy Week 3?\n\nBy Week 3, students have already been exposed to:\n\nThe fundamental distinction between Un-defined, Ill-defined, and Well-defined problems\n\nTrending to the Absurd (extrapolating trends to extremes)\n\nBasic futures thinking\n\nMacro-Changes builds on this foundation by providing a structured approach to environmental analysis. Where Trending to the Absurd is imaginative, Macro-Changes is systematic.\n\nProblem Type Alignment\n\nPrimary: Ill-defined Problems Macro-Changes analysis produces ill-defined problems\u2014we know something is changing and creating opportunities, but we don't yet have clear solution paths.\n\nSecondary: Un-defined Problems When macro-changes are still emerging, the problems they create may be entirely un-defined. Macro-Changes can be used to move from \"we don't know what we don't know\" to \"we know there's a problem here somewhere.\"\n\nPrerequisites and What Comes Next\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nUnderstanding of the three problem types\n\nExposure to basic environmental scanning",

They treat PEST as four separate boxes to fill in.\n\nThe Reality Check: The power of Macro-Changes analysis comes from seeing how forces interact. Isolated factors rarely create significant opportunities. Compound forces do.\n\nThe Fix: After identifying individual forces, explicitly map interactions. Ask: How does this Political change affect Economic factors? How do Economic changes influence Social behavior? Draw the connections.\n\nExample: \"AI regulation\" (Political) is meaningless in isolation. Connected to \"AI capability advancement\" (Technological), \"automation anxiety\" (Social), and \"productivity pressure\" (Economic), it becomes a systems story with clear implications.",

Students spend their analysis explaining why changes are bad for existing players.\n\nThe Reality Check: Every destruction creates opportunity. If your analysis produces only threats, you're doing defensive analysis, not innovation analysis.\n\nThe Fix: For every \"this destroys X\" statement, force yourself to complete: \"which creates the opportunity for Y.\" No exceptions.\n\nExample: \"AI destroys entry-level legal work\" \u2192 \"which creates the opportunity for legal AI tools, human-in-the-loop verification systems, and high-touch legal concierge services.\"\n\nMISTAKE 3: Confusing Trends with Macro-Changes\n\nThe Problem: Students identify trends (things that are growing or shrinking) without assessing whether they have the magnitude to create destruction and opportunity.\n\nThe Reality Check: Most trends are incremental. They'll affect existing players slightly but won't create new problem spaces. Macro-changes are transformative\u2014they make certain things impossible and other things newly possible.\n\nThe Fix: Apply the destruction test: \"What does this trend make impossible or obsolete?\" If the answer is \"nothing much,\" it's not a macro-change\u2014it's just a trend.",

Both are real; only one is actionable now.\n\nThe Fix: Add timing assessment to every force. Is this happening now? 3-5 years? 10+ years? What signals would indicate acceleration or deceleration?\n\nExample: \"Autonomous vehicles will transform transportation\" is true. But if full autonomy is 15+ years away, opportunities today are in driver assistance and fleet management, not robotaxi platforms.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Single-Domain Analysis\n\nThe Problem: Students analyze macro-changes in their primary domain and miss forces from adjacent or upstream domains.\n\nThe Reality Check: The most significant macro-changes often originate outside your primary domain.

Forces often cascade from these domains into yours.\n\nExample: Healthcare providers focused on healthcare trends miss that technology companies are becoming healthcare companies, bringing Silicon Valley macro-changes (platform economics, data leverage, user experience expectations) into healthcare.\n\nMISTAKE 6: Stopping at First-Order Consequences\n\nThe Problem: Students identify what macro-changes will directly destroy but miss the cascading effects.\n\nThe Reality Check: First-order consequences are obvious to everyone. Competitive advantage comes from seeing second and third-order effects.\n\nThe Fix: For each destruction, ask \"And then what?\" at least three times.

You don't need to identify every force\u2014you need to identify the forces that matter most.\n\nThe Fix: After initial scanning, ruthlessly prioritize. Use impact and certainty filters. Focus analysis on the top 3-5 forces with high impact and high-to-medium certainty. Leave the rest as monitoring items.\n\nExample: A comprehensive PEST analysis of healthcare might identify 50+ forces. A useful analysis focuses on 3-5: regulatory shift toward value-based care, AI diagnostic capability, consumer cost-consciousness, labor shortage, and interoperability mandates. Everything else is context.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE MACRO-CHANGES QUESTION\n\nIf you remember nothing else from this lecture, remember this question:\n\n\"What is being destroyed right now that will create the biggest problems worth solving in the next five years?\"\n\nThis question embodies the Macro-Changes mindset:\n\n\"What is being destroyed\": Focus on destruction, not just change\n\n\"Right now\": Require evidence, not speculation\n\n\"That will create\": Insist on the destruction-opportunity connection\n\n\"The biggest problems worth solving\": Prioritize magnitude\n\n\"In the next five years\": Ground in actionable timeframes",

They see it coming, understand what problems it will create, and position themselves to solve those problems before others even recognize they exist.\n\nFINAL THOUGHT\n\nThe world of 2035 will be shaped by macro-changes that are already in motion today. The political forces, economic shifts, social transformations, and technological breakthroughs that will create the next generation of billion-dollar opportunities are not mysteries waiting to be discovered. They are visible now to anyone who looks systematically.\n\nThe question is not whether you can see the macro-changes. With the PEST framework, anyone can. The question is whether you will have the courage to ask what they're destroying\u2014and the imagination to see what they're creating.\n\nEvery empire that falls creates opportunities for new kingdoms. The innovators who thrive in disruption are not those who defend the old order or predict the new one. They are those who see the destruction clearly, understand what problems it creates, and build solutions before anyone else realizes those problems exist.\n\nThe forces of disruption are not threats to be managed.

They didn't need to. By systematically analyzing political forces (rising nationalism), economic forces (Western dependence), social forces (environmental consciousness), and technological forces (alternative energy development), they identified that the favorable conditions could be destroyed\u2014and prepared accordingly.\n\nWhen the crisis hit, Shell was ready. They moved from the weakest of the \"Seven Sisters\" to one of the two strongest\u2014a position maintained for decades.\n\nThe lesson: Systematic PEST analysis reveals vulnerabilities and opportunities invisible to those focused only on their immediate competitive environment.\n\nThe Kodak Tragedy: Seeing the Future and Missing the Point\n\nKodak invented the digital camera in 1975. Their technologists accurately predicted digital imaging would eventually dominate. They had first-mover advantage on the most significant technological shift in their industry.\n\nThey failed anyway.",

They had first-mover advantage on the most significant technological shift in their industry.\n\nThey failed anyway.\n\nKodak analyzed technological change in isolation. They missed how digital photography would destroy their profit engine (film processing revenue), transform photography's social function (from preservation to communication), and shift value capture entirely.\n\nThey asked \"How will technology evolve?\" instead of \"What will technology destroy?\"\n\nThe lesson: Technological trend analysis without full PEST integration is dangerous. You must ask what forces are destroying, not just what they're creating.\n\nTHE PROVOCATION THAT STARTS EVERYTHING\n\nBefore diving into analysis, answer this question with brutal honesty:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd WORKSHEET 0.1: Opening Reflection\n\nWhat assumption in your domain is everyone treating as permanent that macro-forces might already be destroying?\n\nWhat would you do if this assumption collapsed within 5 years?\n\nWhat opportunity might that collapse create?\n\nKeep this worksheet.

    "content": "RED TEAMING: THE ART OF QUESTIONING THE STATUS QUO\n\nA Lecture on Innovation Through Adversarial Thinking\n\nBy Lawrence Aronhime\n\nOPENING PROVOCATION\n\nHere's a question that should make you uncomfortable:\n\nWhat if everything you believe about your product, your market, or your solution is wrong?\n\nNot slightly off. Not in need of minor adjustments. Completely, fundamentally wrong.\n\nMost people never ask this question. They can't afford to\u2014psychologically, financially, or politically. But the innovators who change industries? They don't just ask it. They weaponize it.\n\nThat's what we're here to talk about today: Red Teaming\u2014the systematic art of attacking your own assumptions before someone else does it for you.\n\nWHERE DID THIS MADNESS COME FROM?\n\nThe Prussian War Game (1811)\n\nPicture this: You're a Prussian military officer in the early 1800s. You've spent weeks developing what you believe is a brilliant battle plan. Then, your commander does something strange\u2014he assigns another team to destroy your plan from the enemy's perspective.\n\nThis wasn't friendly feedback. This was organized intellectual combat.\n\nThey called it Kriegsspiel\u2014war gaming. The red team's job was singular: identify every flaw, every blind spot, every assumption that would get soldiers killed in actual combat.\n\nThe goal wasn't to be nice. The goal was to survive.\n\nFrom Battlefield to Boardroom\n\nOver 200 years, this methodology migrated:\n\n1800s \u2192 Prussian military strategy\n\n1960s \u2192 CIA intelligence analysis",

Someone systematically trying to destroy the idea to see if it could survive.\n\nThis is called confirmation bias at scale. Groups naturally reinforce existing thinking rather than challenge it.\n\nThe Red Teaming Alternative\n\nRed Teaming flips this completely:\n\nInstead of asking: \"How can we make this work?\"\n\nWe ask: \"How can this fail spectacularly?\"\n\nInstead of: \"What do users want?\"\n\nWe ask: \"What assumptions about users are we making that could be completely wrong?\"\n\nInstead of: \"How do we improve our product?\"\n\nWe ask: \"How would a competitor destroy our entire business model?\"",

This is rigorous thinking.\n\nTHE THREE CORE PRINCIPLES OF RED TEAMING\n\nPRINCIPLE 1: Think Like an Adversary\n\nAn adversary doesn't see your product the way you do. They see:\n\nVulnerabilities you're blind to\n\nAssumptions you take for granted\n\nOpportunities you're missing because you're too close\n\nExample: The Smartphone\n\nYou think: \"Our phone has great features, excellent design, premium materials.\"\n\nAn adversary thinks:\n\n\"What frustrates users most about needing to carry this device?\"\n\n\"What technology could make smartphones obsolete?\"\n\n\"How do users actually use this vs. how the company thinks they use it?\"\n\nThis is how Tesla questioned whether cars needed gasoline. This is how Netflix questioned whether entertainment needed physical media. This is how SpaceX questioned whether rockets needed to be disposable.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Attack Paradigms, Not Just Products\n\nThe biggest breakthroughs come from challenging fundamental assumptions about how an industry works.\n\nConsider Kodak:\n\nTheir thinking: \"We're the best at film photography\"\n\nThe paradigm they missed: \"Do people need film at all?\"\n\nConsider Netflix vs. Blockbuster:\n\nBlockbuster's thinking: \"We need better retail locations\"",

Assume Breach\n\nCybersecurity principle: Don't ask \"Can we be hacked?\" Ask \"When we're hacked, what happens?\"\n\nYour version: Don't ask \"Will this work?\" Ask \"When this fails, what breaks?\"\n\n3. The Prussian Question\n\nAfter every battle, Prussian officers asked: \"What did we think would happen, and what actually happened?\"\n\nYour version: After every project, ask: \"What assumptions did we make, and which were wrong?\"\n\n4.

The User You Didn't Design For\n\nEvery product optimizes for an assumed user. But what about:\n\nThe non-technical user?\n\nThe adversarial user?\n\nThe user with different cultural assumptions?\n\nThe user 10 years from now?\n\nYour version: Design for the users you ignored.\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)\n\nMISTAKE 1: Red Teaming Once\n\nThe Problem: Treating red teaming as a one-time check box\n\nThe Solution: Institutionalize it. Make it part of your process for every major decision.\n\nExample: SpaceX doesn't just test rockets once. Every launch includes systematic failure analysis that feeds into the next design.\n\nMISTAKE 2: Being Too Nice\n\nThe Problem: Pulling punches because you don't want to hurt feelings or kill momentum\n\nThe Solution: Remember\u2014it's better for ideas to die in the conference room than in the market.\n\nExample: Military red teams are graded on how thoroughly they attack plans. Adopt the same standard.\n\nMISTAKE 3: Red Teaming Without Action\n\nThe Problem: Identifying vulnerabilities but not fixing them\n\nThe Solution: Every red team finding requires a response: fix it, accept the risk, or pivot.",

Use frameworks (Beautiful Questions, Trending to the Absurd, Scenario Analysis).\n\nExample: Saying \"This won't work\" isn't red teaming. Saying \"This assumes X, which fails under conditions Y and Z\" is red teaming.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Only Red Teaming Security\n\nThe Problem: Limiting red teaming to cybersecurity when it applies to everything\n\nThe Solution: Apply it to business models, user experience, strategy, product design, everything.\n\nExample: Netflix red-teamed their entire business model (physical distribution) and found streaming. That's not security\u2014that's strategic innovation.\n\nWHERE RED TEAMING FITS IN PWS METHODOLOGY\n\nRed Teaming is primarily a Week 2 tool for exploring Un-defined Problems\u2014those foresight challenges that require imagining alternative futures.\n\nProblem Type Alignment:\n\nUn-defined Problems \u2192 Red teaming challenges fundamental assumptions\n\nIll-defined Problems \u2192 Red teaming stress-tests emerging solutions\n\nWell-defined Problems \u2192 Red teaming ensures systematic vulnerability assessment",

It's too threatening.\n\nBut consider:\n\nKodak knew digital photography was coming. They invented it. They still failed.\n\nBlockbuster had the chance to buy Netflix for $50 million. They passed.\n\nNokia dominated mobile phones. They missed the smartphone revolution.\n\nWhy? They couldn't imagine their core assumptions being wrong.\n\nRed teaming forces you to imagine it. And once you can imagine it, you can prepare for it. Or better yet\u2014you can cause it and own the disruption yourself.\n\nFINAL THOUGHT: INNOVATION THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE DESTRUCTION\n\nJoseph Schumpeter called it \"creative destruction\"\u2014the process by which innovation constantly destroys old structures to create new ones.",

Levels evolve at different speeds. Structure shifts over time.\n\nFix: Annotate your map with:\n\nSpeed of change at each level\n\nDirection of evolution\n\nEmerging structures\n\nDeclining structures\n\nMISTAKE 2: Missing Cross-Level Interactions\n\nProblem: Seeing only containment (nested structure) but not interactions\n\nReality: Most interesting system dynamics come from how levels influence each other bidirectionally.\n\nFix: Explicitly map:\n\nFeedback loops between levels\n\nConstraints (higher level limits lower level)\n\nEnablement (lower level enables higher level)\n\nEmergence (lower level interaction creates higher level phenomena)\n\nMISTAKE 3: Assuming Linear Causation\n\nProblem: Thinking \"fix component X \u2192 system improves\"",

Small changes can cascade dramatically. Big changes might be absorbed without effect.\n\nFix: Always map cascade effects before assuming impact.\n\nMISTAKE 4: Optimizing Wrong Level\n\nProblem: Solving problems at the level where they manifest rather than where they originate\n\nReality: Visible problems are often symptoms of constraints at other levels.\n\nFix: When stuck, move up or down a level and see if the intervention point changes.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Ignoring Timing and Readiness\n\nProblem: Identifying opportunities without assessing if system is ready\n\nReality: Great ideas fail when other levels aren't prepared to support them.\n\nFix: Always complete enabling/constraining factor analysis. Don't pursue opportunities where too many levels block adoption.\n\nEXAMPLES OF EXCELLENCE\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure\n\nDomain: Electric vehicle adoption\n\nPrimary Trend: Battery technology improving (cost, density, charging speed)\n\nNested Hierarchy:\n\nEnergy policy level\n\n\u2193\n\nUtility and grid level\n\n\u2193\n\nCharging infrastructure level  \u2190 REVERSE SALIENT IDENTIFIED\n\n\u2193\n\nVehicle level\n\n\u2193\n\nBattery level\n\nKey Insight: Battery technology advancing rapidly, but charging infrastructure lagging created bottleneck for EV adoption.",

Examples:\n\n\u2713 \"Why did Edison, who invented the lightbulb, lose the battle for the electrical system?\"\n\n\u2713 \"What kept electric vehicles from mass adoption for 100 years when the technology worked in 1901?\"\n\n\u2717 \"Today we'll learn about finding bottlenecks\" (too generic)\n\nMaking Hughes Concrete:\n\nThe historical material can feel academic. Make it concrete:\n\nShow images of Edison's Pearl Street station vs. modern power grid\n\nMap the DC vs. AC conflict to contemporary technology battles\n\nHave students identify the \"DC system\" in their own industries\n\nAvoiding Abstraction:\n\nStudents often stay abstract. Force specificity:\n\n\"What component?\" \u2192 \"Name it specifically\"\n\n\"It's expensive\" \u2192 \"How expensive? Compared to what?\"",

Direct current couldn't economically transmit more than about one mile from the power station. Edison's team threw tremendous resources at this problem, trying to extend transmission distance through better conductors, higher voltages, and thicker wires.\n\nThey failed. The constraint was fundamental to DC architecture.\n\nMeanwhile, George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla recognized this constraint differently. Rather than trying to solve it within the DC system, they asked: \"What would a system without this constraint look like?\"\n\nThe answer was alternating current, which could use transformers to step voltage up for efficient transmission and down for safe use. AC didn't improve on DC's reverse salient\u2014it eliminated it by changing the architecture.",

AC didn't improve on DC's reverse salient\u2014it eliminated it by changing the architecture.\n\nThe lesson: Correctly identifying the reverse salient is half the battle. Understanding its nature\u2014whether it's solvable within the current system or signals the need for a new paradigm\u2014is the other half.\n\nCautionary Tale: Kodak's Digital Dilemma\n\nIn 1975, Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera. Kodak correctly identified that image quality was a reverse salient\u2014early digital couldn't match film. They invested heavily in improving digital image sensors.\n\nBut Kodak made a critical error in their reverse salient analysis. They focused on the technical constraint (image quality) while ignoring the business model constraint. Their entire profit structure depended on film and photo processing revenue. Even as digital image quality improved, they couldn't address the economic reverse salient without cannibalizing their core business.\n\nCompetitors without film legacy could address the digital opportunity without this constraint. By the time Kodak adjusted, it was too late.\n\nThe lesson: Reverse salients aren't always technical. Economic structures, business models, organizational capabilities, and industry arrangements can all be binding constraints. The most dangerous reverse salients are the ones you don't see because they're embedded in your own assumptions.",

Vague domain definitions produce vague constraint identification. Clear system maps enable rigorous assessment.\n\nPhase objectives:\n\nDefine a specific system with clear boundaries\n\nIdentify the goal toward which the system advances\n\nMap all major components and their relationships\n\nUnderstand information and resource flows\n\nDocument the historical context of the system's development\n\nIdentify key stakeholders who depend on system progress\n\nSTEP 1.1: Domain Selection and Scoping\n\nThe first critical decision is choosing what system to analyze. The scope must be:\n\nBroad enough to capture meaningful constraints (not just one component)\n\nNarrow enough to be analyzable (not \"the entire economy\")\n\nRelevant to problems you actually care about solving\n\nGood scopes:\n\n\"Electric vehicle consumer adoption in North America\"\n\n\"Enterprise software deployment cycle time\"\n\n\"Alzheimer's drug development pipeline\"\n\n\"Residential solar installation economics\"\n\nPoor scopes:\n\n\"Transportation\" (too broad)\n\n\"Our company's Q4 sales\" (too narrow, too internal)",

Ask \"If we solved this tomorrow, would the system truly advance?\"\n\nMistake 2: Picking the Obvious Problem\n\nProblem: Everyone knows batteries are the constraint, so that's where you focus\u2014along with everyone else.\n\nFix: Look for second-order constraints or less obvious approaches to the primary constraint.\n\nMistake 3: Assuming Technical Solutions",

They're innovating in parts of the system that aren't holding anything back.\n\nThink about it: In any complex technological or business system, some components advance rapidly while others lag behind. The lagging components\u2014the reverse salients\u2014are where the real opportunity lives. Because they're the reason the whole system can't progress.\n\nEdison perfected the lightbulb, but it was meaningless without a power distribution system. The smartphone was technically possible years before the iPhone, but batteries couldn't support it. Electric vehicles sat on drawing boards for decades waiting for one thing: battery energy density.\n\nMost innovators pick their problems based on what's exciting or what they know how to do. The best innovators pick problems based on what's actually holding the system back.",

The best innovators pick problems based on what's actually holding the system back.\n\nThis is Reverse Salient Analysis\u2014the systematic identification of components that lag behind in system development, representing not just bottlenecks, but concentrated opportunities for outsized impact.\n\nThomas Hughes, studying the electrification of Western society, coined this term from military strategy. A \"salient\" is a forward-projecting part of a battle line. A \"reverse salient\" is the part that falls behind and becomes vulnerable\u2014the weak point that the entire force must protect or correct before advancing.\n\nIn technology and innovation, reverse salients are the components that hold back everything else. Find them, solve them, and you unlock the entire system.\n\nTHE PROBLEM WITH CONVENTIONAL INNOVATION TARGETING\n\nLet me tell you why most innovation programs produce incremental improvements instead of breakthroughs:\n\nThey spray effort across the entire system instead of concentrating it where it matters.\n\nImagine a company trying to improve its supply chain. They hire consultants who recommend fifty initiatives across warehousing, transportation, inventory management, supplier relationships, and demand forecasting. Resources get spread thin. Progress happens everywhere\u2014and nowhere.",

Which specific component is preventing the entire supply chain from reaching the next level of performance? Maybe it's real-time visibility across handoff points. Maybe it's the inflexibility of contracted transportation capacity. Maybe it's the 72-hour lag in demand signal propagation.\n\nThere's always a constraint that matters more than the others. Systems theory tells us this. Eliyahu Goldratt built an entire management philosophy (Theory of Constraints) around it. But most organizations lack a systematic method for identifying what that constraint actually is\u2014especially in complex technological domains where the bottleneck isn't obvious.\n\nConsider the history of electric power. In the 1880s, multiple inventors worked on improving every aspect of electrical systems\u2014generators, motors, transmission lines, insulators, switches. But Thomas Hughes's meticulous research revealed something crucial: progress came in waves, each triggered by solving a specific reverse salient.",

Then the reverse salient shifted to reliable generators. Then to transmission distance\u2014direct current couldn't economically travel more than a few miles from the power station. This reverse salient couldn't be solved within the DC paradigm, so an entirely new system (alternating current) emerged to address it. Then AC had its own reverse salient: the lack of a practical AC motor.\n\nEach breakthrough came from concentrated attention on the lagging component. Not from general improvement across all fronts.\n\nThis is why reverse salient analysis matters: it tells you where to focus. In a world of limited resources and infinite possibilities, knowing where concentrated effort will have maximum impact is perhaps the most valuable strategic insight you can have.\n\nWHERE THIS THINKING COMES FROM\n\nThomas Hughes and the Electrification of the West\n\nThomas P. Hughes was a historian of technology at the University of Pennsylvania who spent decades studying how large technological systems evolve. His masterwork, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1983), remains one of the most influential studies of technological change ever written.",

In warfare, a salient is a portion of a battle line that projects forward toward the enemy\u2014an aggressive advance. A reverse salient is the opposite: a portion that lags behind, creating a vulnerable indentation in the line that must be corrected before the whole force can advance.\n\nHughes applied this concept to technological systems with devastating precision:\n\n\"A reverse salient appears in an expanding system when a component of the system does not march along harmoniously with other components. As the system evolves toward a goal, some components fall behind or out of line. As a result of the reverse salient, growth of the entire enterprise is hampered, or thwarted, and thus remedial action is required.\"\n\nWhat made Hughes's insight powerful was his observation about what happens next:\n\n\"Having identified the reverse salients, the system tenders can then analyze them as a series of critical problems. Defining reverse salient problems is the essence of the creative process.\"\n\nThis is a profound claim: creativity in technological innovation isn't about generating wild ideas\u2014it's about correctly identifying where the system is stuck and precisely defining the critical problems that, if solved, would unstick it.",

In trench warfare, an uneven battle line creates strategic problems. The portions that advance (salients) become vulnerable to flanking attacks. The portions that fall behind (reverse salients) become pressure points where the enemy can concentrate force.\n\nCommanders face a choice: they can continue advancing the strong points and hope the weak points catch up, or they can concentrate resources on the reverse salient to bring the whole line forward.\n\nIn technological systems, the same dynamic plays out. Some components advance rapidly due to investment, talent, or favorable physics. Others lag behind. And until the lagging components catch up, the entire system is constrained to the capability of its weakest link.\n\nFrom History to Innovation Methodology\n\nHughes's historical insight has become a practical innovation methodology because it answers a question every innovator faces: Where should I focus?\n\nThe answer: Focus on the reverse salient\u2014the lagging component that, if advanced, would allow the entire system to progress. This is where:\n\nResources can have maximum impact\n\nProblems are concrete and defined (not vague)\n\nSuccess can be clearly measured\n\nSolutions have guaranteed demand (the system needs them)",

Sometimes it's hidden (the real bottleneck is software architecture, but everyone is focused on hardware). Often it shifts over time (you solve one reverse salient only to reveal the next one).\n\nPrinciple 2: Reverse Salients Evolve in Sequence\n\nHughes observed that solving one reverse salient often reveals or creates the next. The history of electric power shows this clearly:\n\nEdison solved the filament problem \u2192 revealed generator reliability as next reverse salient\n\nReliable generators \u2192 revealed transmission distance as next reverse salient\n\nAC power solved transmission \u2192 revealed lack of practical AC motor as next reverse salient\n\nPolyphase motor invented \u2192 revealed safety and insulation problems as next reverse salient\n\nThis sequential nature means reverse salient analysis isn't a one-time exercise. It's a continuous discipline of reassessing where the new constraint lies.\n\nPrinciple 3: Correction Can Be Within or Beyond the System\n\nWhen engineers identify a reverse salient, they attempt to solve it within the existing system architecture.

The answer came from outside the DC system: alternating current, which could use transformers to step voltage up for transmission and down for use.\n\nThis principle is crucial: not every reverse salient can be solved within its original context. Sometimes the answer is to build an entirely new system that doesn't have the constraint in the first place.\n\nThe Mechanism: Why This Works\n\nReverse salient analysis works because it aligns innovation effort with system demand.\n\nWhen you solve a reverse salient:\n\nGuaranteed Market: The rest of the system is waiting for this problem to be solved. Demand is proven by the very existence of the bottleneck.\n\nClear Specification: The problem is defined by what the rest of the system needs from this component. Requirements aren't vague\u2014they're set by the interface with adjacent components.\n\nMeasurable Success: You know when you've succeeded because the constraint relaxes and the system can advance.\n\nCompound Value: Your solution doesn't just improve one component\u2014it unlocks value across the entire system.",

The reverse salient was fundamental, not incremental. This fundamental limit created the opening for AC power to emerge.\n\nWhen you encounter a reverse salient that resists all conventional solutions, ask: What would a completely different system architecture look like?

Central power stations generated DC power, which was distributed to nearby homes and businesses for lighting. The technology worked\u2014but it couldn't scale.\n\nIdentifying the Reverse Salient: The DC system had a fundamental constraint: economical transmission distance. DC couldn't be stepped up to high voltage for efficient transmission, so power stations had to be within about one mile of customers. This meant every neighborhood needed its own power station\u2014economically impossible for anything but dense urban areas.\n\nAttempted Solutions Within the System: Edison and his engineers tried everything to extend DC transmission range. Better conductors. Higher voltages (dangerous). Thicker wires (expensive). Nothing worked. The physics of DC power transmission set a hard limit.",

The physics of DC power transmission set a hard limit.\n\nThe Paradigm Shift: Because the reverse salient couldn't be solved within the DC architecture, inventors explored an entirely different approach: alternating current. AC power could use transformers to step voltage up for efficient transmission and down for safe use. This architectural change completely eliminated the transmission distance constraint.\n\nKey Insight: When AC emerged, Edison famously fought it (the \"War of Currents\"). But the reverse salient didn't care about Edison's preference. The DC system's constraint was fundamental, and AC offered a path around it.\n\nWhy This Is Important: Reverse salient analysis revealed not just a problem to solve, but a limit of the existing paradigm. This pattern repeats across innovation history: when a reverse salient proves fundamentally unsolvable within the current architecture, the opening exists for an entirely new approach.\n\nCase Study 2: The Shale Revolution\n\nThe Challenge: The United States had vast reserves of oil and natural gas trapped in shale rock formations.

Synthesis costs are dropping 50% annually. New error-correction codes are being developed.

A manufacturing line runs at the speed of its slowest station. A software system responds with the latency of its slowest service.

The next weakest link becomes the new binding constraint.\n\nApplication: After solving a reverse salient, immediately reassess. Where is the constraint now? Expect the answer to change.\n\nMental Model 3: Within-System vs. Between-System Solutions\n\nSome reverse salients can be solved by improving existing components. Others require entirely new system architectures that don't have the constraint.\n\nApplication: When a reverse salient proves stubbornly unsolvable, ask: \"Is this a fundamental limit of how this system is structured? What would a system without this constraint look like?\"\n\nMental Model 4: The Pace Setter\n\nIn multi-component systems, one component often sets the pace for all others. Improvements to faster components don't help until the pace-setter speeds up.\n\nApplication: Identify the pace-setting component. That's where concentrated innovation effort pays off. Effort elsewhere accumulates as \"inventory\" waiting for the pace-setter to improve.\n\nMental Model 5: Correction Types (Hughes's Framework)\n\nHughes observed that reverse salients can be corrected through multiple mechanisms:\n\nTechnological: Invention or engineering improvement\n\nEconomic: New business models or cost structures",

The opportunity may lie in less-obvious constraints that are equally binding but less recognized.\n\nThe Fix: Look beyond first-order constraints.

In the 1880s, Thomas Edison had created something remarkable\u2014a functioning electric light system. The problem? It only worked within a few hundred yards of the power station. The batteries that stored electricity couldn't hold enough charge to make the system economically viable at scale.\n\nThe obvious answer is \"because batteries weren't good enough.\" But that's not the real answer\u2014that's the surface answer, and surface answers are the enemy of innovation.\n\nThe real answer is: batteries exist within a system of nested hierarchies, and you cannot fix a component without understanding its position within the larger system architecture.",

The problem was that direct current couldn't be transmitted efficiently over long distances. No matter how good you made the battery, you were constrained by a limitation at a higher level of the system hierarchy\u2014the transmission infrastructure. The solution didn't come from building better batteries; it came from changing the system entirely\u2014from direct current to alternating current\u2014which then made different battery designs possible and necessary.\n\nMost innovators miss this. They see a problem in a component and attack that component directly. They spend millions improving batteries when the constraint is in transmission. They redesign user interfaces when the friction is in the business model. They hire better salespeople when the product architecture is fundamentally misaligned with customer needs.\n\nThis is Nested Hierarchies\u2014the systematic method for understanding that every element exists within a system, every system exists within a larger system, and innovation opportunities often lie not in fixing the obvious component, but in understanding how changes at one level cascade through all the others.\n\nTHE PROBLEM WITH COMPONENT-LEVEL THINKING",

Each watch contained about 1,000 parts. Tempus constructed his watches so that if he had to put one down\u2014to answer the phone, say\u2014it immediately fell to pieces and had to be reassembled from scratch. Hora designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten elements each. Ten of these subassemblies constituted a larger subassembly; ten of these formed the whole watch.\n\nIf there is a probability of one in ten that either watchmaker will be interrupted while adding a part, Hora will be interrupted on average 9 times while completing a watch. Tempus, on the other hand, will have to start over, on average, 10 times for every watch he assembles\u2014he will never complete one.\n\nSimon's point was profound: Hierarchical organization isn't just one way to structure complexity\u2014it's the only way complex systems can evolve and persist. Any system that lacks hierarchical organization will be inherently fragile and unable to survive perturbations.",

Innovation opportunities concentrate at the boundaries between levels.\n\nThomas Hughes and Technological Systems\n\nThomas Hughes, the historian of technology whose masterwork \"Networks of Power\" (1983) traced the evolution of electrical systems from 1880 to 1930, provided the empirical grounding for systems thinking in innovation.\n\nHughes showed that technological systems are not just collections of hardware. They are seamlessly interrelated physical, intellectual, and organizational components that evolve together. The electric power system wasn't just generators and wires\u2014it was Edison and Westinghouse, corporate organizations, regulatory bodies, financial markets, consumer expectations, and cultural assumptions about progress.\n\nMost importantly, Hughes introduced the concept of reverse salients\u2014components or aspects of a system that have fallen behind or are out of phase with the others.

As the system evolves toward a goal, some components fall behind or out of line. As a result of the reverse salient, growth of the entire enterprise is hampered, or thwarted, and thus remedial action is required.\"\n\nFor innovation, Hughes revealed that the most consequential innovations address reverse salients\u2014the constraints that hold back entire system hierarchies. Finding these reverse salients requires seeing the whole hierarchy, not just the components.\n\nDonella Meadows and Leverage Points\n\nDonella Meadows, the systems scientist whose \"Thinking in Systems\" became the essential primer for systems thinking, showed us that not all interventions in a system are equal.\n\nMeadows identified a hierarchy of intervention points in systems, ranging from the easiest but least effective (changing parameters like prices or subsidies) to the hardest but most powerful (changing the goals or paradigm of the system).

No matter how good you make a battery, if the transmission infrastructure requires direct current at short distances, the battery's potential is limited by that higher-level constraint.\n\nInnovation Implication: Before optimizing a component, identify what higher-level constraints are limiting its effectiveness. The opportunity may be in changing the constraint, not improving the component.\n\nPrinciple 2: Change Cascades in Both Directions\n\nChanges at any level propagate both upward (affecting the containing system) and downward (affecting contained components). When alternating current replaced direct current, it changed requirements for motors, insulation, safety systems, business models, and regulatory frameworks.\n\nInnovation Implication: Map the cascade effects of any contemplated change. The most valuable innovations create positive cascades across multiple levels.\n\nPrinciple 3: Boundaries Are Where Innovation Lives\n\nThe interfaces between levels\u2014where one hierarchy meets another\u2014are where the most significant innovation opportunities exist.

This is ecosystem strategy informed by hierarchical analysis.\n\nTHE NESTED HIERARCHIES METHOD: SIX STEPS\n\nThe Nested Hierarchies method translates systems thinking into actionable innovation analysis. These six steps take you from selecting a domain to generating a prioritized list of innovation opportunities.\n\nSTEP 1: Select Domain and Define Central Element\n\nObjective: Establish the focal point for your analysis\n\nThe first step is selecting a domain that interests you and identifying the central element you want to analyze. The central element is typically a product, technology, process, or service that you want to understand in its systemic context.\n\nActions:\n\nChoose a domain where you suspect innovation opportunities exist\n\nIdentify the specific element that will serve as your analytical anchor\n\nDefine what \"performance\" means for this element\n\nArticulate why this element matters to you or your organization\n\nQuestions to Ask:\n\nWhat element in this domain feels like it's \"stuck\" or advancing slowly?\n\nWhat element do I have access to improve?\n\nWhat element do customers complain about most frequently?\n\nExample:\n\nDomain: Urban Transportation\n\nCentral Element: Electric Scooter Sharing Services\n\nPerformance Metrics: Utilization rate, unit economics, user satisfaction, safety record",

At each level, different competitors exist, different capabilities matter, and different business models work.\n\nThe Strategic Question: At what level of the hierarchy should we compete?\n\nComponent suppliers compete at lower levels (Intel in CPUs)\n\nProduct companies compete at middle levels (Dell in computers)\n\nPlatform companies compete at boundaries between levels (Apple in ecosystems)\n\nInfrastructure companies compete at high levels (Google in information organization)",

A reverse salient isn't just any problem\u2014it's the rate-limiting step for the entire system. Solving a reverse salient has disproportionate value because it unlocks progress across multiple levels.\n\nHow to test if something is a reverse salient:\n\nIf this problem were solved, would the system advance significantly?\n\nIs progress in other areas being held back by this problem?\n\nAre multiple actors affected by this constraint, not just one?\n\nHas this problem persisted despite significant investment in solving it?\n\nIf yes to all four, you've found a reverse salient worth attacking.\n\nMental Model 3: Cascade Mapping\n\nBefore committing to an innovation, map its cascade effects\u2014how changes will propagate up and down the hierarchy.\n\nPositive Cascades: Your innovation enables improvements at multiple other levels",

When the official purpose and the actual function diverge, innovation opportunities emerge.\n\nOriginal Purpose vs. Actual Function:\n\nUniversities: Education \u2192 Credentialing/sorting\n\nNewspapers: Informing public \u2192 Aggregating attention for advertisers\n\nHealthcare: Making people healthy \u2192 Managing disease for payment\n\nWhen you detect purpose drift, you can either:\n\nCreate a new system aligned with the original purpose (disruptive innovation)\n\nCreate a new system aligned with the actual function (enabling innovation)\n\nExpose the drift and create market pressure for realignment (institutional innovation)\n\nINTEGRATION WITH OTHER PWS TOOLS\n\nNested Hierarchies becomes more powerful when combined with other tools from the PWS methodology. Here's how the integration works:\n\nWith Scenario Analysis:\n\nScenario Analysis asks: What alternative futures are plausible? Nested Hierarchies asks: How do those futures affect different levels of the system?\n\nWhen you've developed scenarios using the 2\u00d72 matrix methodology, run each scenario through your nested hierarchy map. How does Scenario A affect Level +2? How does Scenario B create reverse salients at Level -1?",

Nested Hierarchies asks: Which level of the hierarchy would break first?\n\nTake trends you've identified and extended, then map where in the hierarchy the absurd endpoint would create system failure. This reveals which levels are most fragile and where intervention is most needed.\n\nExample: Trending smartphone screen time to the absurd, where do we see system failure? Individual health (Level -1)? Social relationships (Level +1)? Labor productivity (Level +2)? Democratic participation (Level +3)?\n\nWith Red Teaming:\n\nRed Teaming asks: What are we missing?

Nested Hierarchies reveal: At what level does this reverse salient exist?\n\nWhen you identify a reverse salient, the nested hierarchy shows you whether the constraint is at component level (often solvable with R&D), system level (requires coordination), infrastructure level (requires collective action), or institutional level (requires policy change).\n\nExample: EV charging as reverse salient\u2014Is the constraint in battery chemistry (Level -2)? Vehicle design (Level 0)? Charging network (Level +1)? Electrical grid (Level +2)? Utility regulation (Level +3)? Different levels require different innovation strategies.\n\nWHERE NESTED HIERARCHIES FITS IN PWS METHODOLOGY\n\nWeek Positioning: Week 5\n\nNested Hierarchies is introduced in Week 5 of the PWS curriculum, titled \"Systems Problems: Navigating Complexity.\" This positioning is deliberate:\n\nWhy Week 5?\n\nBy Week 5, students have:\n\nLearned the problem taxonomy (Un-defined, Ill-defined, Well-defined)",

If you start at the component level and only go one level up, you miss the system dynamics that actually determine success.\n\nThe Fix: Always force yourself to map at least 3 levels above your central element. Even if the upper levels seem abstract, they shape everything below.\n\nExample: An engineer improving battery energy density starts at chemistry (Level -2), maps up to battery design (Level -1), reaches device design (Level 0), but stops. They miss how charging infrastructure (Level +1), energy policy (Level +2), and urban design (Level +3) will determine whether any battery improvement actually matters.\n\nMISTAKE 2: Treating Levels as Independent\n\nThe Problem: Analysts map the hierarchy but then analyze each level in isolation, missing the cascading interactions that create both opportunities and constraints.\n\nThe Reality Check: The whole point of nested hierarchies is understanding interdependence. An improvement at one level that creates problems at another level isn't an improvement at all.\n\nThe Fix: For every change you contemplate, explicitly trace its effects both upward and downward through at least 2-3 levels.",

But this cascades down (worse service quality at Level 0) and up (regulatory backlash at Level +2, labor organizing at Level +3). The \"improvement\" creates system instability.\n\nMISTAKE 3: Confusing Components and Levels\n\nThe Problem: Analysts list many components within a single level but call them different levels. This creates a \"hierarchy\" that's actually just a parts list.\n\nThe Reality Check: Different levels have different organizing principles, different dynamics, and different stakeholders. If two things have the same organizing principle, they're probably at the same level.\n\nThe Fix: For each level, ask: \"What is the system purpose at this level? Who are the actors? What are the rules?\" If the answers are the same as the level above or below, you haven't actually identified a distinct level.\n\nExample: Someone lists \"motor, battery, controller, frame\" as four levels of an electric scooter. But these are all components at the same level\u2014they're all part of \"the scooter product.\" The real levels are: subcomponents \u2192 scooter product \u2192 fleet operation \u2192 urban mobility \u2192 city system.\n\nMISTAKE 4: Ignoring Non-Technical Levels",

The upper levels of the hierarchy are where these non-technical constraints live.\n\nThe Fix: Always include at least one level that is primarily social/cultural, one that is regulatory/institutional, and one that is economic/market. These are where most reverse salients hide.\n\nExample: Nuclear fusion researchers map plasma physics, reactor design, and power systems in exquisite detail. But they underweight regulatory approval timelines (Level +2), grid integration challenges (Level +2), and public acceptance (Level +3) that have delayed deployment for decades.\n\nMISTAKE 5: Finding Reverse Salients That Aren't Rate-Limiting\n\nThe Problem: Analysts identify problems and call them reverse salients when they're actually secondary constraints that wouldn't unlock progress even if solved.\n\nThe Reality Check: A reverse salient is specifically the binding constraint that limits system evolution. There's usually only one at a time\u2014multiple constraints can exist, but only one is currently rate-limiting.",

But solving UI wouldn't change adoption\u2014the binding constraints are charging infrastructure and upfront cost. UI is a problem but not the reverse salient.\n\nMISTAKE 6: Mapping Static Hierarchies\n\nThe Problem: Analysts create a snapshot of how the hierarchy exists today without considering how the hierarchy itself is evolving.\n\nThe Reality Check: Hierarchies are dynamic. Levels emerge and disappear. New actors enter at different levels. Boundaries shift. A static map misses the motion that creates the biggest opportunities.\n\nThe Fix: Create two hierarchy maps\u2014one for today and one for your scenario horizon (5-10 years).

After mapping, force prioritization: \"What are the 3 most consequential reverse salients? What are the 3 highest-leverage intervention points?\" Move to action rather than continued analysis.\n\nExample: A team spends three months mapping the healthcare system in ever-increasing detail, cataloging every stakeholder and subsystem.

A business model problem (industry level)? An economic problem (macroeconomic level)?\n\nThe engineer sees a reliability problem with the motor.

Pierre Wack and his colleagues had developed scenario planning, but they found that scenarios alone weren't enough\u2014they needed a way to understand how different futures would affect the entire system of energy production, distribution, and consumption.\n\nWhat they developed was essentially nested hierarchies analysis applied to energy markets:\n\nLevel -2: Resources \u2014 Oil reserves, extraction costs, geology\n\nLevel -1: Technologies \u2014 Drilling, refining, transportation\n\nLevel 0: Production System \u2014 Wells, platforms, refineries, pipelines\n\nLevel +1: Energy Markets \u2014 OPEC, spot markets, contracts, pricing\n\nLevel +2: Industrial Economy \u2014 Manufacturing, transportation, heating\n\nLevel +3: Geopolitics \u2014 Middle East stability, US policy, Soviet production\n\nLevel +4: Global Development \u2014 Economic growth, population, urbanization\n\nWhen the 1973 oil embargo hit, Shell was the only major oil company that wasn't blindsided. They had mapped how disruptions at Level +3 (geopolitics) would cascade through Level +1 (markets) and affect their position at Level 0 (production).",

By the time they recognized this level existed, it was already occupied by digital-native players.\n\nThe Lesson: If Kodak had systematically mapped their hierarchy and looked for shifts at upper levels, they would have seen that their carefully optimized lower levels were becoming irrelevant to a changing system purpose. They might have asked: \"At what level of the hierarchy is the real action happening?\" The answer wasn't cameras or film\u2014it was platforms and social behavior.",

Why?\n\nWhere did your initial hypothesis prove correct?

Why?\n\nWhat cognitive biases did you notice in yourself during this analysis?\n\nHow will you apply nested hierarchies thinking in your future work?\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nMistake 1: Starting Too Low\n\nThe Problem: Beginning analysis at the component level and never adequately exploring containing systems. The Fix: Force yourself to map at least 3 levels above before concluding. Upper levels are usually where the most binding constraints hide.\n\nMistake 2: Confusing Components with Levels",

Upper levels are usually where the most binding constraints hide.\n\nMistake 2: Confusing Components with Levels\n\nThe Problem: Listing many components at a single level and calling them different levels. The Fix: Each level must have different organizing principles, actors, and dynamics. If two things share these, they're at the same level.\n\nMistake 3: Ignoring Non-Technical Dimensions\n\nThe Problem: Mapping technical levels in detail while treating regulatory, economic, and social levels superficially. The Fix: Upper levels are usually dominated by non-technical factors. Give them equal analytical attention.\n\nMistake 4: Declaring a Reverse Salient Without Testing\n\nThe Problem: Identifying a visible problem and calling it a reverse salient without testing whether it's actually rate-limiting. The Fix: Apply all five reverse salient test questions. If solving it wouldn't unlock significant system progress, it's not the reverse salient.\n\nMistake 5: Generating Only Component-Level Opportunities\n\nThe Problem: Focusing opportunity generation on technical improvements without exploring system, ecosystem, or paradigm-level possibilities. The Fix: Force yourself to generate at least 3 opportunities at each level of the hierarchy.\n\nExamples of Excellence\n\nExample 1: Electric Vehicle Adoption Analysis\n\nAn excellent nested hierarchies analysis of EV adoption would show:\n\nLevel Structure:",
