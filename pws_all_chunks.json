It may still be possible for a few firms to keep growing fast by attracting customers from competitors, but this is likely to be increasingly difficult. \nAnother possibility is to expand into new geographic markets, but there are often real limits to this approach. Leading a process of industry consolidation by absorbing competitors can also bring continued growth for some time. But there are obvious limits to this source of growth as well: Even if further consolidation would be economically possible, antitrust is likely to prove a barrier. \nThus, if a firm is to continue to grow at substantial rates, it must ultimately be by developing business opportunities beyond its original scope.\nAcquisitions are one way to get into new businesses. Acquisitions readily lead to higher sale numbers and higher total profits, but the implications for value creation and profitability are less clearly positive. \nIn general, it seems very hard for firms to benefit their owners by buying other firms. The difficulties are twofold. First is to avoid having all the potential value creation flow to the shareholders of the acquired firm. The second is to realize the potential gains once the transaction is completed.",

    "content": "To Exploit Change\n‘Innovation’, then, is an economic or social rather than a technical term. It can be defined the way J. B. Say defined entrepreneurship, as changing the yield of resources. Or, as a modern economist would tend to do, it can be defined in demand terms rather than in supply terms, that is, as changing the value and satisfaction obtained from resources by the consumer.\nSystematic innovation therefore consists in the purposeful and organized search for changes, and in the systematic analysis of the opportunities such changes might offer for economic or social innovation.\nThe overwhelming majority of successful innovations exploit change. To be sure, there are innovations that in themselves constitute a major change; some of the major technical innovations, such as the Wright Brothers’ aeroplane, are examples. But these are exceptions, and fairly uncommon ones. Most successful innovations are far more prosaic; they exploit change. And thus the discipline of innovation (and it is the knowledge base of entrepreneurship) is a diagnostic discipline: a systematic examination of the areas of change that typically offer entrepreneurial opportunities. Specifically, systematic innovation means monitoring seven sources for innovative opportunity.\nEntrepreneurship and Innovation\n‘The entrepreneur,’ said the French economist J. B. Say around 1800, ‘shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield.’ But Say’s definition does not tell us who this ‘entrepreneur’ is. And since Say coined the term almost two hundred years ago, there has been total confusion over the definitions of ‘entrepreneur’ and ‘entrepreneurship’.\nBut to be entrepreneurial, an enterprise has to have special characteristics over and above being new and small. Indeed, entrepreneurs are a minority among new businesses. They create something new, something different; they change or transmute values.",

Innovation, indeed, creates a resource. There is no such thing as a ‘resource’ until man finds a use for something in nature and thus endows it with economic value. Until then, every plant is a weed and every mineral just another rock.\nThe same holds just as true in the social and economic spheres. There is no greater resource in an economy than ‘purchasing power’. But purchasing power is the creation of the innovating entrepreneur.",

    "content": "Principles: Finding the Best Opportunities\nThe Dos:\nPurposeful, systematic innovation begins with the analysis of the opportunities. \nInnovation is both conceptual and perceptual. The second imperative of innovation is therefore to go out to look, to ask, to listen.\nAn innovation, to be effective, has to be simple and it has to be focused. It should do only one thing, otherwise, it confuses. \nEffective innovations start small. They are not grandiose. They try to do one specific thing.\nA successful innovation aims at leadership.\nThe Don’ts:\nThe first is simply not to try to be clever. Innovations have to be handled by ordinary human beings, if they are to attain any size and importance at all,\nDon’t diversify, don’t splinter, don’t try to do too many things at once. This is, of course, the corollary to the ‘do’: be focused!\nFinally, don’t try to innovate for the future. Innovate for the present! An innovation may have long-range impact….\nFinally, there are three conditions: \nInnovation is work. It requires knowledge. It often requires great ingenuity.\nTo succeed, innovators must build on their strengths. Successful innovators look at opportunities over a wide range. But then they ask, ‘Which of these opportunities fits me, fits this company, puts to work what we (or I) are good at and have shown capacity for in performance\n’\nAnd finally, innovation is an effect in economy and society, a change in the behaviour of customers, of teachers, of farmers, of eye surgeons – of people in general. Or it is a change in a process – that is, in how people work and produce something. Innovation therefore always has to be close to the market, focused on the market, indeed market-driven.",

The key to groundbreaking innovation is identifying what the next great problem actually is.\nProblems are discovered not only by getting out of the building, but by getting out of your head — and your current frame of reference.\nAnd we get out of our heads by searching at different boundaries of uncertainty for opportunities: \nfrom the present forward (“What’s probable\n What’s plausible\n”) and \nfrom the future back (“What’s possible\n”).\nWhat is the Problem Here\n\nGuglielmo Marconi was an Italian electrical engineer and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909, known for the development of a wireless telegraphy (T.S.H.) or radiotelegraphy system.\nFrom youth, Marconi was interested in science and electricity. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of “wireless telegraphy” – i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph.\nOr Here\n\nGPT-3: Where is the Problem Worth Solving",

Although initially fully open-source, with the increased capacity of parameters after their GPT-2 version, OpenAI has privatized their code. \nAccording to The New Yorker, the second iteration of this AI tool used 17 billion parameters to build the base knowledge for the deep learning algorithm. In this third version, the parameters increased by more than 10 times, now holding a whopping 175 billion parameters. This significant increase in parameters has also translated into a significant increase in applicability, as the new algorithm has opened the door for generative algorithms which actually create text-based solutions that matter, and that also makes sense.\nI’ll be honest.

Surprises and errors can play havoc with plans and with smooth operations. In their zeal to reduce uncertainty and minimize errors, organizations fall into the predictability trap and the perfection trap.\nInsight is the opposite of predictable. Insights are disruptive. They come without warning, take forms that are unexpected, and open up unimagined opportunities. Insights get in the way of progress reviews because they reshape tasks and even revise goals. They carry risks—unseen complications and pitfalls that can get you in trouble.\nBusiness organizations treat disruptive insights and innovations with suspicion…defining performance by what can be objectively measured and downplaying the rest.\nThese forces—the need for predictability and the need for perfection (avoidance of errors)—aren’t values that organizations choose. They seem to be inherent in the very nature of organizations.\nSome of the activities listed in the table have definite benefits: having standards, having management controls, conducting progress reviews, expecting people to justify their conclusions, using checklists, setting up schedules. The problem arises when they are pursued with so much zeal that they interfere with insights.",

Errors are easy to define, easy to measure, and easy to manage. The quest for perfection, for mistake-free performance, can be thought of as the War on Error. It is right up there with the quest for predictability. These are both inherent in running an organization that depends on managing people and projects. In well-ordered situations, with clear goals and standards and stable conditions, the pursuit of perfection makes sense. But not when we face complex and chaotic conditions, with standards that keep evolving.\n…\nChecklists and procedures ensure predictability. They work best when all the uncertainties have been resolved and the practitioners converge on a standard way to work safely, efficiently, and effectively. These processes work best in well-ordered situations with clearly understood tasks. Unfortunately, organizations often are tempted to use them in complex situations with ambiguous tasks.\n…\nHowever, insights can take us beyond perfection.

There are other types of frames besides stories, such as maps and even organizational wiring diagrams that show where people stand in a hierarchy. My work centers on stories because they are common ways we frame the events in the situations we encounter. These kinds of stories organize all kinds of details about a situation and depend on a few core beliefs we can call “anchors,” because they are fairly stable and anchor the way we interpret the other details. In some later research I found that most of these stories build on only three or four anchors.\n...So I had a working definition of insight—an unexpected shift to a better story—along with the ways insights transform us. I also had some ideas about what makes insights unique. Compared with routine problem solving, insights aren’t conscious or deliberate. They come without warning. Our minds do their heavy lifting without our awareness.\nInsights are unique in some other ways. When they do appear, they are coherent and unambiguous. They don’t come as part of a set of possible answers. When we have the insight, we think, “Oh yes, that’s it.” We feel a sense of closure. This sense of closure produces a feeling of confidence in the insight.\n…As a friend summarized all these transformations, “Insight is when it happens, everything that happens afterward is different.”",

    "content": "The Triple Path Model\nThe Triple Path Model shows why earlier accounts aren’t wrong as much as they are incomplete. They restrict themselves to a single path. \nResearchers and theorists …who describe insight as escaping from fixation and impasses are referring to the creative desperation path. \nResearchers who emphasize seeing associations and combinations of ideas are referring to the connection path. \nResearchers who describe insight as reformulating the problem or restructuring how people think have gravitated to the contradiction path. None of them are wrong. \nThe Triple Path Model of insight illustrates why people seem to be talking past each other. It’s because they’re on different paths.\nMultiple Paths\nI’ve combined the connections, coincidences, and curiosities in the Triple Path Model. They have the same dynamic: to build on a new potential anchor. They have the same trigger: our thinking is stimulated when we notice the new anchor. Coincidences and curiosities aren’t insights in themselves; they start us on the path to identifying a new anchor that we connect to the other beliefs we hold. Connections, coincidences, and curiosities have the same activity: to combine the new anchor with others. This path to insight doesn’t force us to abandon other anchors. It lets us build a new story that shifts our understanding. This path has a different motivation, a different trigger, and a different activity from the contradiction and the creative desperation paths. Nevertheless, like the other two paths, the outcome is the same: an unexpected shift in the story.\nThis shift isn’t a minor adjustment. It means changing the core components, the anchors, used in the story. With contradictions and creative desperation, some of the previous anchors are discarded. With connections, a new anchor is added. In all the paths the anchors in the story after we make an insight are different from the ones we started with.\nEach of the three paths, the contradiction path, the connection path, and the creative desperation path, gets sparked in a different way. And each operates in a different fashion: to embrace an anomaly that seems like a weak anchor in a frame, to overturn that weak anchor, or to add a new anchor.\nThe bottom of the diagram of the Triple Path Model shows different routes to the outcome. It shows some direct routes from the three strategies, but also some crossovers. That’s because many of the insights in my sample relied on more than one path.\nMultiple paths are the rule, not the exception. The diagram doesn’t show all possible blends, which would get complicated. Most of the blends relied at some point on the connection path, and so I have portrayed the other two paths joining the connection path.",

Sometimes the person sees a new way to combine different kinds of information even if none of them are new.\nThe strategy offers a clear image of insights as connecting the dots. And it suggests that we can increase insights by exposing ourselves to lots of different ideas that might help us form new connections.\n…\nThese examples come across as connecting the dots because I haven’t told you about all the non-dots. The non-dots would have slowed the stories down, but they are an important part of each insight—determining which dots to connect. Anyone can connect the dots if we remove the non-dots and clarify the ambiguous dots and group the dots that look different but are really the same. If all that is left is a set of unique and valid dots, then the job of connecting the dots becomes much easier. If we leave in all the ambiguities, then the connection gets trickier.\nThe connection path thrives on having lots of ideas swirling around and on making accidental linkages. The more swirl and turbulence, the greater the chance for a discovery.",

Usually we have to discard some of our earlier beliefs, even major ones that have anchored our understanding up to now. \nContradiction insights send us on the road to a better story. They signal that there’s something seriously wrong with the story we’re currently telling ourselves.\n\nContradictions are different from curiosity insights. Curiosities make us wonder what’s going on, whereas contradictions make us doubt—“That can’t be right.” Contradictions between theory and evidence, between expectations and observations….\nWe are built to notice associations and coincidences, and we are also built to detect anomalies, inconsistencies, irregularities. We are built to attend to cues that violate our expectancies and arouse our curiosity. We are built to be surprised.\nAre contradictions really insights, or are they what lead to an insight\n They certainly lead to insights, to the better story. I believe they also count as an insight.

We use the contradiction path to notice, search for, and apply inconsistencies and anomalies. We use the connection path to increase our exposure to novel ideas. When we get stuck, we use critical thinking methods to locate and correct flawed assumptions and beliefs. Now we can cut through some confusion about ways to achieve insights. Is it important to be exposed to lots of different ideas\n Perhaps for those using the connection path, but not for the others. Is the insight process a matter of breaking through fixation and impasses\n For situations involving the desperation path, but not for the others.\nCreative Desperation\nCreative desperation, a fifth insight strategy, is very different from connecting ideas or noticing coincidences or curiosities or contradictions. Creative desperation requires finding a way out of a trap that seems inescapable.\nBoth the contradiction cases and the cases of creative desperation directed people’s attention to outliers—important beliefs that weren’t firmly supported. However, in the desperation cases people did not look for ways to reframe their understanding around the weak, anomalous anchor. Just the reverse. People who are in desperate straits attack the weak anchor instead of embracing it. In times of desperation, we actively search for an assumption we can reverse. We don’t seek to imagine the implications if the assumption was valid. Rather, we try to improve the situation by eliminating the assumption.\nNotice that creative desperation is more conscious and deliberate than spotting connections, coincidences, curiosities, and contradictions. People aren’t accidentally stumbling onto insights. They are actively searching for them. The creative desperation path requires us to critically examine our assumptions to detect any that are tripping us up.",

So I am forced to imagine where the insight came from. I imagine Dodge and the crew running for their lives, dropping their tools, realizing they are trapped. I try to imagine Dodge’s beliefs about what is going on. Four beliefs in particular seem to anchor Dodge’s understanding. One anchor is the uphill slope. It favors the fire, not the runners, and it is getting steeper. A second anchor is the fire behind me. It is picking up speed. Perhaps a third anchor is any island of safety I might find. If I could get to the top of the ridge, the fire would stop racing after me. Or if I could find a rocky patch, the fire might leave me alone because it wouldn’t have any fuel. I see a rocky area way up ahead (the other two survivors reached these rocks and took protection there), but I know I can’t get there in time. It is about 200 yards away, uphill yards, with the fire perhaps thirty seconds behind me. A fourth anchor is the heavy dry grass I am running through, bunchgrass and cheatgrass. It is the fuel that the fire is eating. I don’t spend any time thinking about how to change the slope of the valley walls or beat the fire back. These anchors are part of my situation, but beyond my control. I can’t reach the rocky areas on the ridge before the fire will catch me. But maybe I can do something to this last anchor, to the fuel. How can I neutralize the fuel\n Of course! I can burn it! Fire, my enemy, can also be my friend. I light the escape fire to race up the slope ahead of me, and I dive into the hot ashes, my sanctuary from the blowup.

It is a process to create a portfolio of possible futures, each representing a different way your business landscape could look in a few years, and not just the landscape, but also the players who inhabit it—your competitors, customers, suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders. The scenarios will naturally differ from each other in some key aspects, probably even dramatically so, but in its essential makeup, each one will be realistic and entirely possible, given your reading of today’s trends. Based on these different scenarios, you and your planning team can then sit down and formulate more flexible strategies that ensure your organization has the agility to compete in whichever future does in fact come to pass—even one that is different again from the scenarios envisaged.\nThe essence of leadership, therefore, is to be constantly gaming the future—grasping its possibilities, communicating a vision of the role you want your organization to play in this new future landscape, and inspiring your team to help you make that vision a reality.\nExploration Plus Preparation\nScenario planning doesn’t try to predict an ironclad picture of how the future will turn out. …Instead, scenario planning aims to illuminate and explore different ways the future might realistically develop. The scenarios generated by this thinking (always more than one, as we’ll see in a moment) should be regarded as insightful indicators of what could come to pass in the future, depending on the breaks. The idea is that this mix of trends and developments will make a particular kind of future more likely. \nScenarios are therefore stories that reveal how a certain future constellation of market and environmental factors would look and feel. But alas, a scenario is not a prophecy that any particular future will actually come to pass. If only it were that easy! By going through a scenario planning process, you’re acknowledging that predicting “the” future is not possible and that instead, there are myriad forces, interacting and feeding off each other, that will be driving your organization toward some unknown future.\n“I can’t see the future, but I have to plan for it anyway.” That’s the CEO’s classic dilemma.",

Interviewees bring subjective opinion and subtle judgment into the equation, but also imagination and blue-sky thinking—all based on experience. All of these things are valuable. \nWho to interview\n \nWhat to ask\n \nIdentify a number of knowledgeable, opinionated people—preferably stakeholders in your future success, or people with an interest in how your environment will develop. How many interviews should you conduct\n Cast your net as widely as you can. You should talk to at least as many people as there will be in the group that will meet to carry out the scenario planning exercise; some planners recommend a ratio of three or even five interviewees to one workshop participant.\n\nIf you could see 10 years into the future, what two or three things would you look for that would help you understand how the future has turned out",

Identifying Driving Forces\n﻿Now we come to the workshop itself, the crucible in which the participants meet, discuss, argue, and (we hope) finally agree on certain key attributes of the future and craft scenarios based on these choices.\nWhat exactly is a driving force\n In a nutshell, a driving force is something with the potential to bring about significant change in the future. It may be a trend, already clearly defined and understood—for example, the falling fertility rate in Italy, which will have a fairly predictable impact on the number of Italians who will be 20 years old two decades from now. Another kind of driving force is a variable that has the potential to change the future in significant ways but is not very predictable as it is itself dependent on several factors. A good example is the price of oil.\nThe classic tool for helping generate a list of driving forces is the “PEST” model. \nThere are other models out there that include additional categories, such as “Environmental” (which turns PEST into STEEP). Probably the most exhaustive one that I’ve seen breaks driving forces down into a whopping 10 categories: Social, Technological, Economic, Business methods, Natural resources, Political, Demographic, International, Legal, Environmental",

    "content": "Pest Analysis\nThe basic PEST analysis includes four factors:\nPolitical factors are basically how the government intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including tax policy, labour law, environmental law, trade restrictions, tariffs, and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided …and those that the government does not want to be provided…. Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the health, education , and infrastructure of a nation.\nEconomic factors include economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation rate. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm’s cost of capital and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy.\nSocial factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour).

Although chains of association have huge benefits, they also carry costs. They inhibit our ability to think broadly.\nIn the search for intersections, low barriers provide an advantage. The problem is that there are strong benefits to keeping our natural cognitive barriers in place. Our brain evolved the way it did for a reason.

A person with high associative barriers will quickly arrive at conclusions when confronted with a problem sine their thinking is more focused. He or she will recall how the problem has been handled in the past, or how others in similar situations solved it.\nA person with low associative barriers, on the other hand, may think to connect ideas or concepts that have very little basis in past experience, or that can be traced logically.\nHow to Make Barriers Fall\nPeople succeed at breaking down their associative barriers because they did one or more of the following things:\nExposed themselves to a range of cultures\nLearned differently\nReversed their assumptions\nTook on multiple perspectives\nPeople step into the Intersection by generating lots of random combinations.

In fact, these two critical elements are indispensable to every single innovation story in the world: \nOne element is the big idea. Obviously, at the heart of every significant innovation there is a compelling and value-creating idea of some kind—a new combination of thoughts. \nThe other element is the illuminating insight (or insights). Without fail, every big idea was preceded by at least one insight—a new and penetrating understanding into a situation or problem. \nThese two elements of the creative thinking process—the insight and the idea—are invariably present in each case, and are always inextricably connected. Why\n Because if there was one universal law of innovation, it would be this: Powerful new ideas are never simply snatched out of the air. They are always inspired by insights.\nFour Lenses: The Sources of Insights\nAs we have learned so far, there were four particular perspectives or patterns of thinking that became prevalent in the Renaissance period:    \nHarnessing Trends:  Recognizing the future potential of emerging developments, and using these trends to open up new opportunities   \nUnderstanding Needs:  Paying attention to issues and frustrations others have ignored, and experimenting with new solutions to problems\nChallenging Orthodoxies:  Questioning deeply entrenched beliefs and assumptions (i.e. received wisdom), and exploring new and highly unconventional answers   \nLeveraging Resources:  Understanding our limitless capacity for redeploying skills and assets in new ways, combinations, or contexts   \nHARNESSING TRENDS",

    "content": "Example: Amazon\nExample: Blockbuster\nFour Types of Macro Changes\nIn general, four types of changes make opportunities for new businesses: changes in technology, changes in political and regulatory rules, changes in social and demographic factors, and changes in industry structure:\n…technological change allows people to do things that could not be done before or only could be done in a less efficient manner…. The magnitude of the technological change is important. The larger the technological change, the greater the opportunity for new businesses to be created because larger magnitude changes affect more uses for technology, allowing the use of new technology in more things. \nWhy do political and regulatory changes enhance entrepreneurial opportunity\n Deregulation creates opportunity because it allows more variance in ideas to be put forward by entrepreneurs who might have been barred from entry under a regulated regime. \nSocial and demographic changes open up opportunities for new technology businesses by altering people's preferences and creating demand for things where demand had not existed before. \nSometimes, industry structure shifts because firms that supply other firms or major customers die or because firms merge or acquire each other. These types of shifts change the competitive dynamics in an industry and open up or close down niches that may provide opportunities for entrepreneurs. \nExamples\nFrom Charles Kirschbaum (Insper):\nGrowing demand for eco-friendly products\nThe health and wellness industry is experiencing significant growth, driven by factors such as an aging population\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote work and many employees do not want to return to face-to-face work\nConsumers increasingly seek personalized experiences and products\nGrowing demand for businesses that prioritize social and environmental impact\nFour Great Disruptive Forces\nSpeed, surprise, and sudden shifts in direction in huge global markets routinely impact the destinies of established companies and provide opportunities for new entrants. \nIn fact, ours is a world of near-constant discontinuity. Competitors can rise in almost complete stealth and burst upon the scene. Businesses that were protected by large and deep moats find that their defenses are easily breached. Vast new markets are conjured seemingly from nothing. Technology and globalization have accelerated and intensified the natural forces of market competition\nA radically different world is forming. The operating system of the world’s economy is being rewritten as we speak. It doesn’t come out in a splashy new release. It evolves, unfolds, and often explodes. \nThe Four great disruptive forces:\nThe shifting locus of economic activity\nThe impact of technology\nDemographics\nFlows and Connectivity\nThe Metaverse\n…the metaverse is a combinatorial technology: it combines elements of many of the top trends that the McKinsey Technology Council identified this year as most promising, including \nAI, \nimmersive reality, \nadvanced connectivity, and \nWeb3.",

This focus on technological transitions is important because, most of the time, entrepreneurs target the wrong type of technological change to establish their new businesses. They start their businesses to exploit incremental change. By focusing on incremental change, entrepreneurs often find that they cannot compete with established firms and fail. \nWhat successful technology entrepreneurs have come to realize is that, to be successful, new ventures need to target technological transitions, points when an industry is shifting from one basic technology to another, such as when the printing industry shifted from hot lead linotype machines to cold off-set printing generated by computers. \nYour new venture will be greatly advantaged by focusing on technological transitions because they undermine the advantages of established firms. The reluctance of established firms to embrace these transitions will allow you to enter an industry and use the new technology to develop a business that is based on what may ultimately becomes a better technology than that belonging to the established firm.\nDiminishing Returns\nNew technology tends to develop in an evolutionary manner…. The incremental advances that occur within a technological framework and the radical shifts between technology frameworks can be presented graphically using a concept called the S-curve. Developed by Richard Foster, a McKinsey consultant, the S-curve shows the performance of a technology as a function of the amount of effort expended to develop it. \nUltimately, all technologies reach diminishing returns, making it difficult for managers to achieve very marked performance improvement in their technologies. At these points when technologies are facing these diminishing returns, new firms can often successfully enter industries with new technologies.",

Markets are also fragmented, with many small competitors.\nTechnology S-Curves\nBoth the rate of a technology’s performance improvement and the rate at which technology is adopted in the marketplace have repeatedly been shown to conform to an S-curve \nThe S-curve model suggests that technological change is cyclical\nEach new S-curve ushers in an initial period of turbulence, followed by rapid improvement, then diminishing returns, and ultimately is displaced by a new technological discontinuity\nEmergence of a new technological discontinuity can overturn the existing competitive structure of an industry, creating new leaders and new losers\nAn Evolutionary Process\nTechnological change can be fruitfully characterized as a sociocultural evolutionary process of variation, selection, and retention. Variation is driven by stochastic technological breakthroughs. Technological discontinuities initiate substantial technological rivalry between alternative technological regimes. Social, political, and organizational dynamics select single industry standards or dominant designs from among technological opportunities. Positively selected variants then evolve through relatively long retention periods, marked by incremental technical change and increased interdependence and enhanced competence within and between the communities of practitioners. \nTechnological advance may, then, be driven by the combination of chance or random events (variation), the direct social, political action of individuals and organizations in selecting between rival industry standards (selection), and the incremental, competence-enhancing, puzzle-solving actions of many organizations that are learning by doing (retention).",

    "content": "Technological Discontinuities and Dominant Design\nTushman and Anderson (1986) highlighted a powerful source of variation by demonstrating that the core technology of an industry evolves through long periods of incremental change punctuated by technological discontinuities. This paper extends that work by exploring the other key punctuating event in the evolution of a technology: the emergence of a dominant design after a technological discontinuity. \nWe argue that a breakthrough innovation inaugurates an era of ferment in which competition among variations of the original breakthrough culminates in the selection of a single dominant configuration of the new technology. Successful variations are preserved by the incremental evolution of this standard architecture until a new discontinuous advance initiates a new cycle of variation, selection, and retention. The key punctuation points are technological discontinuities and dominant designs; these delimit eras of ferment and eras of incremental change. \nAt rare and irregular intervals in every industry, innovations appear that \"command a decisive cost or quality advantage and that strike not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms, but at their foundations and their very lives\" (Schumpeter, 1942: 84). Such innovations depart dramatically from the norm of continuous incremental innovation that characterizes product classes, and they may be termed technological discontinuities. These discontinuities either affect underlying processes or the products themselves.",

They represent, in my description of it, what happens to a business when a major change takes place in its competitive environment. A major change due to introduction of new technologies. A major change due to the introduction of a different regulatory environment. The major change can be simply a change in the customers' values, a change in what customers prefer. Almost always it hits the corporation in such a way that those of us in senior management are among the last ones to notice.\nThe biggest difficulty with Strategic Inflection Points is telling one from the many changes that impinge on you in the business. \nHow do you know if a change is just a garden variety change or qualified to be this monumental, catastrophic change category that we call an Inflection Point\n \nI could never come up with a particularly satisfactory answer to that question.\nIndicators of a Strategic Inflection Point\nHas your most dangerous competitor changed\n\nDo the people you have worked with for years suddenly make no sense\n\nAre there customers out there rejecting your offering for something else entirely\n\nAre customers paying attention to new technologies that you are ignoring",

These are empirical observations. \nOne of the empirical observations with companies that are dealing with Strategic Inflection Points, or are in the middle of them, is that there is a growing divergence, a dissonance if you will, between the strategy statements of those companies and the strategy actions. Which of those two adapts to the new realities first\n It is strategic actions. Because strategic actions are driven by the competition, driven by the sales force, driven by the sheer necessity of winning business in the marketplace day in and day out. It is a long way before the collection of those strategy actions ends up into the reformulation of what the corporation says it is about.\nWe have a phrase inside Intel. We are supposed to be a data driven company and the phrase is, \"Don't argue with the emotions, argue with the data.\" \nAnd I'm going to say you have to argue with the data at times like this because the data that deal with your business are pertinent to your past, and don't say anything about your future. And the Strategic Inflection Point is a minor activity at present growing in the future and you will never find it in data.\nThe People Who Bring You the Bad News\nIn the system that I described to you, these people tend to be lower level people. They have to bring you bad news and be Cassandras against the senior management, against the fear of management of repercussions. Unless you deal with this fear, unless you live this fear you will never hear from those helpful Cassandras and you are going to be late in responding to the Strategic Inflection Points.\nAlthough they can come from anywhere in the company, Cassandras are usually in middle management. Often they work in the sales organization. They usually know more about upcoming change than the senior management because they spend so much time “outdoors” where the winds of the real world below in their faces.\nThe most important tool in identifying a particular development as a strategic inflection point is a broad and intensive debate.

People must try different techniques, review different products, exploit different sales channels and go after different customers. Much as management may like to make and keep order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old runs will bring new insights.\nThe dilemma is that we can not suddenly start experimenting when we realize we are in trouble unless we have been experimenting all along. It’s too late to do it once things have changed in our core business.\nTaking an organization through a strategic inflection point is a march through unknown territory. The rules of business are still not clear. People lack a mental map of the new environment, and even the shape of the desired goal is not completely clear.\nThe Key is Culture\nAn organization that has a culture that can deal with these two phases – debate (chaos reigns) and a determined march (chaos reined in) – is a powerful, adaptive organization. \nSuch an organization has two attributes:\nIt tolerates and even encourages debates. These debates are vigorous, devoted to exploring issues, indifferent to rank and include individuals of varied backgrounds.\nIt is capable of making and accepting clear decisions, with the entire organization then supporting the decision.\nOrganizations that have these characteristics are far more ready to deal with a strategic-inflect ionpoint than others. \nThe other side of the valley of death represents a new industry order that is hard to visualize before the transition. Getting through the strategic inflection point means going through a period of confusion, experimentation and chaos, followed by a period of single-minded determination to pursue a new direction toward an initially nebulous goal.\nWHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGES",

They perform jobs that formerly had only inadequate or nonexistent solutions. \nJobs are never simply about the functional — they have important social and emotional dimensions, which can be even more powerful than functional ones. \nBecause jobs occur in the flow of daily life, the circumstance is central to their definition and becomes the essential unit of innovation work — not customer characteristics, product attributes, new technology, or trends. \nJobs to Be Done are ongoing and recurring. They’re seldom discrete “events.”\nWe Don’t Create Jobs, We Discover Them\nIt’s important to note that we don’t “create” jobs, we discover them. Jobs themselves are enduring and persistent, but the way we solve them can change dramatically over time. Think, for example, of the job of sharing information across long distances. That underlying job has not changed, but our solutions for it have: from Pony Express to telegraph to air mail to email and so on. \nOur understanding of the Job to Be Done can always get better.

    "content": "Seeing the Job\nIn practice, seeing a job clearly and fully characterizing it can be tricky. Jobs insights are fragile — they’re more like stories than statistics. When we deconstruct coherent customer episodes into binary bits, such as “male/ female,” “large company/ small company,” “new customer/ existing customer,” we destroy meaning in the process. \nJobs Theory doesn’t care whether a customer is between the ages of forty and forty-five and what flavor choice they made that day. Jobs Theory is not primarily focused on “who” did something, or “what” they did— but on “why.” \nUnderstanding jobs is about clustering insights into a coherent picture, rather than segmenting down to finer and finer slices. \n… it’s important to emphasize that a well-defined job is multilayered and complex. And that is actually a good thing. Why\n Because it means that perfectly satisfying someone’s job likely requires not just creating a product, but engineering and delivering a whole set of experiences that address the many dimensions of the job and then integrating those experiences into the company’s processes.\nFinding Jobs to be Done\nThere are many ways to develop a deep understanding of the job, including traditional market research techniques. While it’s helpful to develop a “job hunting” strategy, what matters most is not the specific techniques you use, but the questions you ask in applying them and how you piece the resulting information together. \nA valuable source of jobs insights is your own life. Our lives are very articulate and our own experiences offer fertile ground for uncovering Jobs to Be Done. Some of the most successful innovations in history have derived from the experiences and introspection of individuals. \nWhile most companies spend the bulk of their market research efforts trying to better understand their current customers, important insights about jobs can often be gathered by studying people who are not buying your products — or anyone else’s — a group we call nonconsumers. \nIf you observe people employing a workaround or “compensating behavior” to get a job done, pay close attention. It’s usually a clue that you have stumbled on to a high-potential innovation opportunity, because the job is so important and they are so frustrated that they are literally inventing their own solution. \nClosely studying how customers use your products often yields important insights into the jobs, especially if they are using them in unusual and unexpected ways. \nMost companies focus disproportionately on the functional dimensions of their customers’ jobs; but you should pay equally close attention to uncovering the emotional and social dimensions, as addressing all three dimensions is critical to your solution nailing the job.",

But there’s an equally important moment that doesn’t show up in most sales data: when you actually “consume” it. \nThe moment a consumer brings a purchase into his or her home or business, that product is still waiting to be hired again — we call this the “Little Hire.” If a product really solves the job, there will be many moments of consumption. It will be hired again and again. But too often the data companies gather reflects only the Big Hire, not whether it meets customers’ Jobs to Be Done in reality. \nThe Storyboard\nDeeply understanding a customer’s real Job to Be Done can be challenging in practice. Customers are often unable to articulate what they want; even when they do describe what they want, their actions often tell a completely different story. \nSeemingly objective data about customer behavior is often misleading, as it focuses exclusively on the Big Hire (when the customer actually buys a product) and neglects the Little Hire (when the customer actually uses it). The Big Hire might suggest that a product has solved a customer’s job, but only a consistent series of Little Hires can confirm it. \nBefore a customer hires any new product, you have to understand what he’ll need to fire in order to hire yours. Companies don’t think about this enough. Something always needs to get fired. \nHearing what a customer can’t say requires careful observation of and interactions with customers, all carried out while maintaining a “beginner’s mind.” This mindset helps you to avoid ingoing assumptions that could prematurely filter out critical information. \nDeveloping a full understanding of the job can be done by assembling a kind of storyboard that describes in rich detail the customer’s circumstances, moments of struggle, imperfect experiences, and corresponding frustrations. \nAs part of your storyboard, it’s critically important to understand the forces that compel change to a new solution, including the “push” of the unsatisfied job itself and the “pull” of the new solution. \nIt is also critical to understand the forces opposing any change, including the inertia caused by current habits and the anxiety about the new. \nIf the forces opposing change are strong, you can often innovate the experiences you provide in a way that mitigates them, for example by creating experiences that minimize the anxiety of moving to something new. \nThe iPad: Escaping Presentism\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech that his company’s\n“Strategy is really simple. What we want to do at Apple, is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.”\nApple’s first tablet computer was the Newton Message Pad 100 introduced in 1993…. Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.\nApple reentered the mobile-computing market in 2007 with the iPhone. Smaller than the (not yet announced) iPad and featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the multitouch finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple’s iOS mobile operating system.\nBy late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years. Such speculation mostly talked about “Apple’s tablet….” The actual name is reportedly an homage to the Star Trek PADD, a fictional device very similar in appearance to the iPad. The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Jobs at an Apple press conference….\nJobs later said that Apple began developing the iPad before the iPhone….",

It sold gourmet beans and equipment so customers could make their own coffee. In 1981, a sales rep for one of its suppliers visited to see why four small stores in Seattle were selling more of a simple drip setup than all of Macy’s.\nHis name was Howard Schultz. Like Ray Kroc, the milkshake machine peddler who saw potential in the McDonald brothers’ burger joint, Schultz thought big. Starbucks could go national, he told the owners, with “dozens of stores, maybe even hundreds,” and become a brand-name “synonymous with great coffee.” In 1982, he joined the company as marketing chief.\nHere, Starbucks history gets complicated. Inspired by the coffee bars he saw on a 1983 trip to Milan, Schultz wanted to bring ubiquitous cafés to the U.S. When Starbucks wouldn’t take the idea beyond a test store, he started his own company, called Il Giornale.\nThe parting was amicable, with the owners of Starbucks investing in his new venture. Within a few years, they were ready to concentrate on other businesses and, in 1987, they sold Starbucks to Schultz.\nHow Did They Do It",

Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne\n“Blue Ocean Strategy” \n(Harvard Business Review: Oct, 2004)\nRed Oceans and Blue Oceans\n… the business universe consists of two distinct kinds of space, which we think of as red and blue oceans. Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today-the known market space. In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are well understood. Here, companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the space gets more and more crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody.\nBlue oceans denote all the industries not  in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than  fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. There are two ways to create blue oceans:\nIn a few cases, companies can give rise to completely new industries, as eBay did with the online auction industry. \nBut in most cases, a blue ocean is created from within a red ocean when a company alters the boundaries of an existing industry.",

Before long, the wines produced in Gaul were exceptionally famous all around the world.\nFrench wines have set the standard for the wine industry for centuries.\nMain Types of Wine \nFive Main Types of Wine\nAll wines can be organized into five basic groups. Within each group there are hundreds of different grape varieties and winemaking techniques! \nRed Wine: Still wine made with black grapes. Red wines range from light to bold.\nWhite Wine: A still wine produced from white and occasionally black grapes. Flavors in white wines span from light to rich.\nRosé Wine: Still wine from black grapes produced by removing the skins before they stain the wine deep red. Rosé is also made by blending red and white wine together. Both dry and sweet styles of rosé are common.\nSparkling Wine: A style of winemaking involving a secondary fermentation that makes bubbles! Sparkling wine can be red, white, or rosé and ranges from lean and dry, to rich and sweet.\nDessert Wine: A style of winemaking involving fortifying wine with spirits. Typically, dessert wines taste sweet, but many dry, fortified wines exist, such as dry Sherry.\nThe Traditional Producers\nChateau Pichon-Longueville in Pauillac, Bordeaux  (France)\nThe Traditional Vocabulary\nCommon Words to Know on a French Wine Label\nCru – translates as “growth,” a favorable vineyard\nVielles Vignes – old vines\nChâteau or Domaine – wine estate\nAppellation d’Origine Protegée – AOP, highest tier of French wine\nIndication Géographique Protégée – IGP, Regional French wines, middle tier of French wine\nVin de France – French table wines, lowest tier of French wine\nCrémant – sparkling wine not from the Champagne region\nBlanc – white\nRouge – red\nMillésime or Récolte – vintage or harvest date\nCuvée – house blend\nRéserve – implies a higher quality, but an unregulated term\nClos – translates as “an enclosure,” usually an enclosed vineyard",

We buy meanings. \nThe more meaningful something is, the more we are attracted to it. Innovation has typically been seen as a matter of “problem solving”. Firms compete to provide better solutions to problems. From this perspective meanings are considered something to understand, not something to innovate. But meanings cannot merely be understood. Meanings can also change and be innovated.\n…innovation driven by design is and how it stands apart from other approaches of innovation. It shows that design is related to the innovation of the meaning of products and services: an innovation that concerns the purpose, the ‘why’ people use things, rather than the functionality and performance of products (i.e. the ‘what’ and ‘how’).\nExample:  “Consumption-driven wealth and status are being replaced by identity, belonging, and a strong desire to contribute and do something “meaningful” rather than just acquire things.”",

    "content": "Example\nExample\nLook Beyond Features and Functions\n…people do not buy products but meanings. People use things for profound emotional, psychological, and sociocultural reasons as well as utilitarian ones. Analysts have shown that every product and service in consumer as well as industrial markets has a meaning. Firms should therefore look beyond features, functions, and performance and understand the real meanings users give to things. The common assumption, however, is that meanings are not a subject for innovation: they are a given. One must understand them but cannot innovate them. \nInnovation has therefore focused on two strategies: quantum leaps in product performance enabled by breakthrough technologies, and improved product solutions enabled by better analysis of users’ needs. The former is the domain of radical innovation pushed by technology, and the latter of incremental innovation pulled by the market. \nPeople Do Not Buy Products, They Buy Meaning\nHowever, companies such as Nintendo, Apple, Artemide, Whole Foods Market, Alessi, and many others discussed in this book show that meanings do change—and that they can change radically. These firms therefore also purse a third strategy: design-driven innovation— that is, radical innovation of meaning. Think for example at the Nintendo Wii that transformed consoles from a passive immersion in a virtual world approachable only by niche experts into an active physical entertainment for everyone, in the real world, through socialization. Or at Whole Foods Market, that has radically changed the meaning of healthy nutrition from a severe, self-denying choice to a hedonic one, and shopping from a chore to a reinvigorating experience.\nThese firms have not provided people with an improved interpretation of what they already mean by, and expect from, a console or an organic food store. Rather, they have proposed a different and unsolicited meaning, that was what people were actually waiting for. \nTHE DESIGN-DRIVEN INNOVATIONS INTRODUCED BY THESE FIRMS HAVE NOT COME FROM THE MARKET BUT HAVE CREATED HUGE MARKETS. They have generated products, services, and systems with long lives, significant and sustainable profit margins, and brand value, and they have spurred company growth.\nNew Meaning as the Driver of Value\nCreating innovations of meaning brings your interaction with customers to a higher level: the level of love. It focuses on what worth really is: value for a person. People do not fall in love with a better  performance. That's a date. Love for a person, as well as for anything in life, comes from meaning. The best metaphor for describing innovation of meaning is to think of it as a \"gift.”\nIn our current world, however, the main driver of value is not just meaning, but new meaning. Customers nowadays face an unprecedented scenario: their context changes at an extreme speed, and therefore their problems and search for meaning keep changing. Companies that focus on innovating solutions often find themselves launching a great new product that unfortunately solves a problem that meanwhile has become old. There is no value in a better performance if this performance is no longer meaningful.",

The problem of poverty in Texas is grossly similar but discretely different from poverty in Nairobi, so no practical characteristics describe “poverty.” \nIt’s hard, maybe impossible, to measure or claim success with wicked problems because they bleed into one another, unlike the boundaries of traditional design problems that can be articulated or defined. \nSolutions to wicked problems can be only good or bad, not true or false. There is no idealized end state to arrive at, and so approaches to wicked problems should be tractable ways to improve a situation rather than solve it. \nThere is no template to follow when tackling a wicked problem, although history may provide a guide. Teams that approach wicked problems must literally make things up as they go along. \nThere is always more than one explanation for a wicked problem, with the appropriateness of the explanation depending greatly on the individual perspective of the designer. \nEvery wicked problem is a symptom of another problem. The interconnected quality of socio-economic political systems illustrates how, for example, a change in education will cause new behavior in nutrition. \nNo mitigation strategy for a wicked problem has a definitive scientific test because humans invented wicked problems and science exists to understand natural phenomena. \nOffering a “solution” to a wicked problem frequently is a “one shot” design effort because a significant intervention changes the design space enough to minimize the ability for trial and error.\nEvery wicked problem is unique. \nDesigners attempting to address a wicked problem must be fully responsible for their actions.",

Because Births is a flow (representing the rate of increase in Population), and Population is a stock, a CLD (causal loop diagram) does not represent this system as accurately as does a stock and flow diagram. In the CLD, both links in this loop are “s” links, indicating that as Births increase, Population increases (a change in the same direction), and as Population increases, Births increase (another change in the same direction).\nHowever, this representation is not completely accurate. If Birth Rate declines, causing Births to decrease, say from 1000 to 900 per month, Population does not in turn decrease; it continues to increase, only at a slower rate than before. Thus the “s” link from Births to Population is accurate only when Births is increasing, because Births and Population do not move in the same direction when Births decrease.\nIn contrast, a stock and flow diagram makes it visually apparent that Births is an inflow to Population and thus can only increase it, not decrease it (because there cannot be a negative number of births).

    "content": "Summary\nR1 (Fish Regenera8on Loop): More adult fish leads to more regeneration rate for a given fractional regeneration rate, which generates more adult fish a9er the maturation time delay. This is the key regeneration loop that causes fish population to grow over time . \nB2 (Limits to Growth Loop): Healthy ecosystem in the diagram denotes carrying capacity. There is a carrying capacity in the marine ecosystem that supports a given amount of fish population. More fish, higher fish density for a given carrying capacity (thus less nutrients per fish), which leads to lower fractional regeneration rate. When total fish population reaches its carrying capacity, reproduction slows down, as there is no more capacity to support further population growth. Starting from a small population relative to this carrying capacity, the fish population over time will grow and eventually stabilizes near this carrying capacity. \nR2 (Race for Fish Loop): less adult fish stock, less catch per unit effort, which lowers fishing income and drives up fishing effort. More fishing effort increases catch and further declines fish stock. This is a key reinforcing loop that causes the fishery to collapse. \nR3 (Fish Price Loop): overfishing (both legal and illegal catch) causes market price to collapse and reduces income, which drives up fishing effort and leads to further overfishing. \nR4 (Erosion of Carrying Capacity Loop): more fishing effort leads to more habitat damage and erodes carrying capacity, which lowers regeneration rate and increases mortality rate that leads to fishery decline. \nR5 (Economic Growth Loop): less fishing income leads to more non‐fishing activities such as aquaculture and agriculture. Without proper regulation, these economic activities increase pollution and cause faster erosion of healthy ecosystem. \nR6 (Healthy Ecosystem Loop): habit conservation and pollution regulation improve ecosystem health, which attract eco‐tourism as alternative income, reduce fishing effort and polluting activities, and further improve ecosystem health. \nR7 (Sustainable Fish Loop): healthy ecosystem improves fish quality. Under Catch Shares program, fishermen have incentives to improve the health of fishery, which could lead to higher price premium for certified fish. Higher price allows fishermen to meet their income target with lower catch, which helps restore the fish stock. \nR8 (Civic Engagement Loop): sense of urgency, program benefits and stakeholder trust building increase civic engagement in program implementation, which further reinforce program benefits, trust building and civic engagement. This is a key implementation loop for scaling up the fishery restoration.",

    "content": "The Flow of Information\n﻿Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.\n﻿If information-based relationships are hard to see, functions or purposes are even harder. A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system. The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.\n﻿Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.\n﻿An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation.\n﻿Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.\n﻿A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same.\nStocks and Flows\n﻿A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. A system stock is just what it sounds like: a store, a quantity, an accumulation of material or information that has built up over time. It may be the water in a bathtub, a population, the books in a bookstore, the wood in a tree, the money in a bank, your own self-confidence. A stock does not have to be physical.\n﻿ ﻿A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.\nStocks change over time through the actions of a flow.

A stock, then, is the present memory of the history of changing flows within the system.\nExamples\nFeedback Loops\n﻿﻿Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.

    "content": "﻿A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.\nBalancing and Reinforcing Feedbacks\n﻿Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to change.\n﻿The presence of a feedback mechanism doesn’t necessarily mean that the mechanism works well. The feedback mechanism may not be strong enough to bring the stock to the desired level. Feedbacks—the interconnections, the information part of the system—can fail for many reasons. Information can arrive too late or at the wrong place. It can be unclear or incomplete or hard to interpret. The action it triggers may be too weak or delayed or resource-constrained or simply ineffective.\n﻿The second kind of feedback loop is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that can cause healthy growth or runaway destruction. It is called a reinforcing feedback loop, and will be noted with an R in the diagrams. It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there (and less input the less that is already there). A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it.\n﻿Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity to reinforce or reproduce itself.\nLEARN TO THINK IN SYSTEMS\nALBERT RUTHERFORD\n(KINDLE DIRECT PUBLISHING: 2019)\nParts of a System\n﻿Systems are made up of three parts:\nElements; \nInterconnections;\nFunctions or purpose. \nThe word “function” is used when talking about a non-human system, and the word “purpose” is used for human systems. \nElements are the actors in the system. \nThe interconnections show the relationship of these actors with one another. \nThe function or purpose is the voluntary or involuntary motivator and catalyst for the elements’ interconnections.\nStocks and Flows\n﻿Donella Meadows, in her book Thinking in Systems: A Primer, refers to stocks and flows as being the foundation of every system.\nStock:  A stock can be something physical, like the amount of money in your account, your business inventory, or the information needed to write a book. However, stocks don’t necessarily have to be physical things. They can also be feelings or attitudes people hold. The amount of anger you hold toward a cheating spouse or an alcoholic parent can also be viewed as a stock. Stocks are not static. They change over time based on the impacts of a flow. Stocks are snapshots in time, showing a current condition of the changing flows in the system. \nFlow:  Flows are the actions that impact a system. A flow might be a success or a failure, purchases or sales, deposits or withdrawals, births or deaths, or growths or declines. To illustrate how flows impact the stocks, I’ve added Picture 3. The rectangle stands for the stock. This stock is affected by two flows, specifically an inflow and an outflow. Stocks can be affected by multiple inflows and outflows, but for the sake of simplicity let’s stick to only one of each. The little clouds represent where the flows come from or go. Flows can be increased or decreased through intervention.\nThe General Rules of Stocks and Flows\n﻿If there are more inflows than outflows, the level of stock will increase. \nIf there are more outflows than inflows, the level of stock will decrease. \nIf the amount of outflows and inflows is equal, the stock level will remain at its current level and will be unchanged. This is called dynamic equilibrium. \nThe level of a stock is increased if its outflow is decreased or its inflow is increased. \nStocks provide a security barrier in a system, since they serve to delay the initial shock that may affect a system. \nStocks preserve the ability of inflows and outflows to remain independent.\nCOMPONENTS\n﻿Systems dynamics show the nonlinear behavior tendencies of complex systems. \nWith the help of stocks, flows, feedbacks, and delays we can detect how quickly changes happen within the system. Often the behavior of the whole system can’t be explained based only on the behavior of its individual parts. In other words, determining what kinds of interactions are at play between the elements is very important. \nStocks and flows are the building blocks of the systems dynamics model. \nThe components of systems stories are: \nVariables; \nLinks; \nMental Models; \nDirection of Links; \nDelays; \nFeedback Loops\nVariables\n﻿Variables are usually neutral nouns. They present elements in situations where behavior patterns change over time. \nDavid Peter Stroh, a systems thinking expert, defines variables as “the nouns of Systems Thinking language. They are the key forces in a systems story that impact each other and change, or literally vary, over time. As such they are critical elements in building a compelling understanding of what has been happening and why. Systems Thinking has the advantage of being able to combine quantitative variables such as profits with qualitative variables such as morale.”\nVariables in systems thinking language have a few strict characteristics. Besides being neutral nouns, they are not events. The value of a variable can go up and down over time. The nouns you use for variables should incorporate the level of change over time.\n﻿Performance measuring variables: When we want to solve a complex problem with the help of systems thinking, we usually face an issue with more than one “symptom of dysfunction.” It’s a good idea to also have more than one performance measure we wish to understand and change.\n﻿Stroh identifies and groups five types of general variables: “\nGoals \nDesired level of __________ \nThinking/feeling/perceptions  \nLevel of commitment to __________ \nLevel of alignment around __________ \nLevel of clarity about __________ \nPerceived level of __________ \nMorale \nDemand  \nPressure to __________ \nNeed for __________ \nDemand to __________ \nGap between __________ and __________ \nCompetitive Pressure \nSupply  \nCapacity for __________ \nAbility to __________ \nAvailable resources (e.g., time/people/experience) for __________ \nInvestment in __________ \nResults  \nActual level of performance (e.g., profitability, revenue, cycle time, cost, turnover, customer satisfaction, market share) \nQuality of __________”\nLinks and the Direction of Links\n﻿To discover and understand links, one should select a variable and ask: \nWhat are possible causes for an increase or decrease in this variable\n Name these factors as variables (nouns, something that can increase or decrease). \nWhat are the possible consequences or effects of an increase or decrease in this variable\n Name these effects as variables.\n﻿We can assess which direction the first variable will pull the second. In systems thinking language, we differentiate two directions: the same direction (S) or the opposite direction (O).\n﻿When you design a feedback or causal diagram, it’s good to indicate the direction of your links. This practice not only makes the diagram easier to follow but also helps to discover possible missing variables that could add important information to the analysis.\nMental Models\n﻿Mental models are our (or the system’s) beliefs, norms, and cultural \"truths.\" \nThese are important determinants of the system’s behavior we are examining.\n﻿Interventions that disregard the importance of habits and beliefs end up being costly and ineffective. \nChanges in any infrastructure without the close following of belief changes are not successful.\nFeedback Loops\n﻿When a system displays a consistent behavior over time, it is likely there is a mechanism at work controlling and creating that behavior. The mechanism works through what we call a feedback loop. Feedback loops either keep a stock’s level within a certain range or make it increase or decrease. No matter the feedback loop’s strength, the inflows and outflows to and from the stock are determined by the size of the stock itself.\n﻿Again, the stock’s size determines the amount of increase or decrease the feedback loop generates over time. Identifying the variables and the links between them leads to the discovery of a feedback loop (or causal loop – both names are used interchangeably).\n﻿There are two types of feedback loops. …The performance-over-time pattern gives a visible hint about the structure determining the behavior. \nReinforcing processes lead to growth or decay. They are often referred to as vicious or virtuous cycles. \nBalancing processes work to stabilize the stock at a given level. The balancing process can be referred to as a goal-seeking or limiting due to a constraint.\n﻿The loops can be designed to be read either clockwise or counterclockwise. All that matters is consistency and the correct order of the relationship. \nA loop can’t be reinforcing and balancing at the same time. If you can’t decide which case applies, it means the story is not yet finished. Add more variables and links to the loop story until you can determine the nature of the loop (balancing or reinforcing).\nExamples",

Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) take a lot of the challenge out of this sometimes nerve-wracking event. In fact, on slippery surfaces, even professional drivers can't stop as quickly without ABS as an average driver can with ABS.\nThe theory behind anti-lock brakes is simple. A skidding wheel(where the tire contact patch is sliding relative to the road) has less traction than a non-skidding wheel. If you have been stuck on ice, you know that if your wheels are spinning you have no traction. This is because the contact patch is sliding relative to the ice. By keeping the wheels from skidding while you slow down, anti-lock brakes benefit you in two ways: You'll stop faster, and you'll be able to steer while you stop.\nExample: How Can Patient Compliance be Improved\n\nExample: How Can MLB Regain its Popularity",

They are: \nOutcomes focused: A clear statement of the problem to be solved, expressed in outcomes, not activities or intermediate outputs. \nSpecific and measurable wherever possible. \nClearly time‐bound. Designed to explicitly address decision‐maker values and boundaries, including the accuracy needed and the scale of aspirations. \nStructured to allow sufficient scope for creativity and unexpected results—too narrowly scoped problems can artificially constrain solutions. \nSolved at the highest level possible, meaning for the organization as a whole, not just optimized for a part or a partial solution.",

    "content": "Mind Mapping\nA mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged radially around a central key word or idea. Mind maps are used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, decision making, and writing.\nThe elements of a given mind map are arranged intuitively according to the importance of the concepts, and are classified into groupings, branches, or areas, with the goal of representing semantic or other connections between portions of information. Mind maps may also aid recall of existing memories.\nBy presenting ideas in a radial, graphical, non-linear manner, mind maps encourage a brainstorming approach to planning and organizational tasks. Though the branches of a mind map represent hierarchical tree structures, their radial arrangement disrupts the prioritizing of concepts typically associated with hierarchies presented with more linear visual cues. This orientation towards brainstorming encourages users to enumerate and connect concepts without a tendency to begin within a particular conceptual framework.\nThe Rules of Mind Mapping\nThe rules of mind mapping are “intended to help you to a free and good judgment.” They are “the children of sound experience,” having been extensively tested and refined over the past thirty years. \nAll you need to begin mind mapping is a topic, a few colored pens, and a large sheet of paper. Follow these rules: \nBegin your mind map with a symbol or a picture (representing your topic) at the center of your page. Starting at the center opens your mind to a full 360 degrees of association. Pictures and symbols are much easier to remember than words and enhance your ability to think creatively about your subject. \nWrite down key words. Key words are the information-rich “nuggets” of recall and creative association. \nConnect the key words with lines radiating from your central image. By linking words with lines (“branches”), you’ll show clearly how one key word relates to another. \nPrint your key words. Printing is easier to read and remember than writing. \nPrint one key word per line. By doing this, you free yourself to discover the maximum number of creative associations for each key word. The discipline of one word per line also trains you to focus on the most appropriate key word, enhancing the precision of your thought and minimizing clutter. \nPrint your key words on the lines and make the length of the word the same as the line it is on. This maximizes clarity of association and encourages economy of space. \nUse colors, pictures, dimension, and codes for greater association and emphasis. Highlight important points and illustrate relationships between different branches of your mind map. You might, for instance, prioritize your main points through color coding, highlighting in yellow the most important points, using blue for secondary points, and so forth. Pictures and images, preferably in vivid color, should be used wherever possible; they stimulate your creative association and greatly enhance your memory.",

They often suggest major themes.\n\nStep 4\nConnect related parts of your mind map with arrows, codes, and colors. \nEliminate elements that seem extraneous.

[MECE] says that when data from a category is desired to be broken into subcategories, the choice of subcategories should be\ncollectively exhaustive — i.e., the set of all subcategories, taken together, should fully characterize the larger category of which the data are part (“no gaps”)\nmutually exclusive — i.e., no subcategory should represent any other subcategory (“no overlaps”)\nThis is desirable for the purpose of analysis: mutual exclusivity avoids the risk of double counting information, and collective exhaustion avoids the risk of overlooking information. In plain English, MECE says that a list should have\nNo overlaps\nNo gaps\nMECE\nMutually Exclusive: The branches of the tree don't overlap, or contain partial elements of the same factor or component. This is a little hard to get your head around, but it means that the core concept of each trunk or branch of the problem is self‐contained, not spread across several branches. \nCollectively Exhaustive:  Taken as a whole, your tree contains all of the elements of the problem, not just some of them.

It results from a ‘power law’ distribution.  Examples of this principle: \nWealth: The top 20% of the population own more than 80% of the nation's wealth.\nScience: The top 20% of published papers account for more than 80% of all cited works in subsequent publications.\nComputing: Fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs eliminates 80% of errors and crashes in a given system.\nEntertainment: The top 20% of titles make up more than 80% of viewers/listeners.\n80/20 Rule Thinking\n“80/20” Thinking is Counterintuitive \nWe tend to expect that all causes have roughly the same consequences. Examples:\n\nIn Business: That all customers are equally valuable; that every product, every sales dollar, every geography is as good as any other. That each employee in the same category is roughly as good as the other.\n\nIn Our Lives: That each day or week or year we spend has roughly the same significance. That each of our friends and social activities have roughly the same value to us. Or, conversely, that most of our joys or frustrations are contributed roughly equally by each of them.\n\nIn Our Careers: That our classes, and concepts taught, have roughly the same value to us.

At the same time less than 10 percent of medical errors are reported. \nExample: Medication Errors\nPer the WHO, there is no consensus about the definition of a medication error. A systematic literature review found 26 different terminologies employed for a medication error.\nMedication errors can occur in \ndeciding which medicine and dosage regimen to use (prescribing faults—irrational, inappropriate, and ineffective prescribing, underprescribing, overprescribing); \nwriting the prescription (prescription errors); manufacturing the formulation (wrong strength, contaminants or adulterants, wrong or misleading packaging); \ndispensing the formulation (wrong drug, wrong formulation, wrong label); \nadministering or taking the medicine (wrong dose, wrong route, wrong frequency, wrong duration); monitoring therapy (failing to alter therapy when required, erroneous alteration). \nThey can be classified, using a psychological classification of errors, as knowledge-, rule-, action- and memory-based errors. \nAlthough medication errors can occasionally be serious, they are not commonly so and are often trivial. However, it is important to detect them, since system failures that result in minor errors can later lead to serious errors.\nClass Exercise\nPrepare an issue tree for\nHow can consumers reduce food waste\nA problem you are currently working on\nYour choice",

(Fifth why, a root cause)\nThe questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause. The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect through any layers of abstraction to a root cause that still has some connection to the original problem. Note that, in this example, the fifth why suggests a broken process or an alterable behaviour, which is indicative of reaching the root-cause level.\nIt is interesting to note that the last answer points to a process. This is one of the most important aspects in the 5 Why approach - the real root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist. Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower.

Later in a project, we often challenge those constraints, but it’s important to understand current perceptions. \nObserve real people in real-life situations to find out what makes them tick: what confuses them, what they like, what they hate, where they have latent needs not addressed by current products and services\nVisualize new-to-the-world concepts and the customers who will use them. Some people think of this step as predicting the future, and it is probably the most brainstorming-intensive phase of the process. Quite often, the visualization takes the form of a computer-based rendering or simulation, though IDEO also builds thousands of physical models and prototypes every year. For new product categories we sometimes visualize the customer experience by using composite characters and storyboard-illustrated scenarios. In some cases, we even make a video that portrays life with the future product before it really exists. \nEvaluate and refine the prototypes in a series of quick iterations. We try not to get too attached to the first few prototypes, because we know they’ll change. No idea is so good that it can’t be improved upon, and we plan on a series of improvements. We get input from our internal team, from the client team, from knowledgeable people not directly involved with the project, and from people who make up the target market. We watch for what works and what doesn’t, what confuses people, what they seem to like, and we incrementally improve the product in the next round. \nImplement the new concept for commercialization. This phase is often the longest and most technically challenging in the development process, but I believe that IDEO’s ability to successfully implement lends credibility to all the creative work that goes before.",

Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions.

Encourage another push or introduce a small variation. Or take a jump, either back to an earlier path you skipped by too quickly or forward to a completely new approach. Whatever you do, try to get into the next power curve and keep the energy up,\nTHE SPACE REMEMBERS  Great brainstorm leaders understand the power of spatial memory. Write the flow of ideas down in a medium visible to the whole group. \nSTRETCH YOUR MENTAL MUSCLES  One type of warm-up we practice is a fast-paced word game simply to clear the mind….

That you need to think “outside the box” to be truly original and innovative. That you should start with a problem and then “brainstorm” ideas without restraint until you find a solution. That you should “go wild” making analogies to things that have nothing to do with your products, services, or processes. That straying as far afield as possible will help you come up with a breakthrough idea. We believe just the opposite. We’ll show you that more innovation— and better and quicker innovation— happens when you work inside your familiar world (yes, inside the box) using what we call templates. …the majority of new, inventive, and successful products result from only five templates: \nsubtraction, \ndivision, \nmultiplication, \ntask unification, and \nattribute dependency. \nThese templates form the basis of the innovation method called Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT).",

With this technique, a component has been copied but changed in some way, usually in a way that initially seemed unnecessary or odd. \nTASK UNIFICATION.  With some creative products and services, certain tasks have been brought together and unified within one component of the product or service— usually a component that was previously thought to be unrelated to that task. \nATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY.

We’ve actually introduced it to you already: the notion that the best and fastest way to innovate is to look at resources close at hand. \nThe second principle requires retraining how your brain thinks about problem solving. Most people assume that the way to innovate is to start with a well-defined problem and then try to think of solutions. In our method, it is just the opposite. We start with an abstract, conceptual solution and then work back to the problem that it solves. Therefore, we have to learn how to reverse the usual way our brain works when innovating.",

By defining and then closing the boundaries of a particular creative challenge and then looking only inside these boundaries, you can be more creative more consistently than by musing about the stratosphere or, worse, waiting for the muse to descend. \nThe Closed World is based on the idea that you look inward rather than outward, and that this propels you toward the virgin territory of truly creative ideas— ideas that are both original and useful. …these ideas all satisfied two conditions: \nFirst, they contradicted some essential belief in the prevailing wisdom about the right way to do things. \nSecond, all the solutions were contained in a relatively small space surrounding the problem. …the Closed World of the problem.\n…our Closed World principle says that the further you go from the problem, the less creative you will be. \nWhich brings us to another important point: the purpose of the Closed World is to teach creativity first and foremost. It’s not to always come up with the best solution to a problem at hand. Sometimes the best solution to a problem can actually be found outside the box. But if your goal is to systematize creativity, you have to operate within the confines of the Closed World. That is key. \n…by limiting the number of variables under consideration from infinity to a finite number, we amplify our potential to come up with a creative solution. Why\n Such limits boost the creative process, allowing individuals to be more focused. \nPerhaps when people eliminate resources and pare down their problem world to its basic elements, they tap into their own natural resourcefulness. Creativity is really about an intelligent search among a limited list of possibilities, rather than random, long-distance outward leaps and bounds. This, then, is our first rule: look inside! \nWebinars\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch\nv=HAZZ5Aleuag",

Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits. \n…by “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.

Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new.\n\nEvery startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.

    "content": "READ FROM SLIDE\nUncertainty is not risk\nRisk is the probability of loss, injury, or other adverse outcome. It can be estimated and calculated based on our knowledge of prior outcomes and conditions. It has been mathematically formulated since the late 17th century, notably in the work of Blaise Pascal. Most importantly, it can be managed. Risk can be distributed (syndicated), insured against, hedged, and reduced. In short, it can be quantified and controlled.\nUncertainty is different. It is not subject to exact quantification. It was only recently formalized in the early 20th century work of the economist Frank Knight. It represents all of the possible future states of the world at any given time. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the number of possible outcomes, both positive and negative. It is a source of discomfort because we cannot predict it, but it is also a source of potential value. Higher uncertainty means greater potential, and most of us underestimate the extent of that potential since there are more possible future states of the world than we can possibly comprehend.\nWhile some view the two as essentially the same and use the words interchangeably, uncertainty is quite distinct from risk, both in its character and in its use. In fact, what sets highly successful entrepreneurs and innovators apart from the rest of the population is the ability to see and use this difference as the basis for their success. The good news is that we can learn from them.\nBtw, this distinction is also why most companies want to size existing markets -- if you have heard the expression \"TAM\" or \"SAM\" (total addressable market, or serviceable addressable market), these are measures of existing, known, markets, since one can numerically estimate the current size of these. My corporate clients often ask me to help them estimate these sizes.    \nEntrepreneurs on the other hand discover entirely new markets -- there is no \"addressable market\" until they do what Drucker famously said in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which is, to \"create a customer.\"  Once we know there are customers for, say, hula hoops or carbonated drinks or spreadsheets, only then can we create an estimate of a TAM.\nWe manage risk, but exploit uncertainty\nEntrepreneurs and innovators see value in uncertainty since they earn profits when gains are appreciably greater than is generally expected.\nWho plays in each quadrant\n  What kind of problem is being addressed in each quadrant\n – use space as an example for each quadrant\nTop right: governments; defense departments; where the bets are very big and nothing is clear; e.g. hypersonics, quantum computing; and once nuclear energy and space exploration (over the past two decades, over 10,000 space companies have entered what is being called “new space” (article: The new space race could turn science fiction into reality by RANA FOROOHAR)\nBottom right: big companies; local governments; where the bets are big in markets and technologies that are well-understood; e.g. battery factories; space: SpaceX, Blue Origin, ViaSat\nBottom left: company R&D departments; small inventors; the usual incremental, sustaining improvements that are necessary to maintain current products and markets – the problem here is that corporations spend way too much time researching and predicting the present\nWe want to build X, and we want to differentiate it from the offerings of competitors\nBut how do we do that if both they and us are all operating under the same assumptions\n – are our assumptions about the future valid",

Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new.\n\nEvery startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: its easier to dominate a small market than a large one.

It follows a logical progression from understanding what innovation is, to how to\nthink about problems, to specific tools for finding and solving them.\n\n**Preface**\n\nSuppose you wanted to create a startup\n  How would you begin\n This is the exercise that we have run (many times) at the start of our Innovation classes (both graduate and undergraduate) at Johns Hopkins University, Israel Institute of Technology, and Hebrew University, in addition to workshops all over the world. We ask students what’s the next big thing in e-commerce, or education, or saving the planet, or healthcare, or whatever timely topic shows up in the newspapers that day.\n\nStudents respond by getting together, and then brainstorm ideas. Others make lists of interesting and insightful people and ask them for ideas. Others walk down the street and try to see what is not there. Some search the newspapers for the latest world-altering disasters; or check social media for the latest hot trends. Others look at popular technology journals for the latest in scientific research, and so on.",

These are incredibly talented students, many of them engineers and scientists, often working in research labs on important and timely topics with famous professors. So why are their ideas so un-interesting\n\nToo many entrepreneurship courses assume that students already have a good idea, and the goal of the class is to validate the idea, find the best product-market fit, and figure out how to turn it into a real startup. Just as too many design classes assume that students already have a good problem to solve, and the goal of the class is to work through the design thinking process and develop that great solution. Everywhere you look there is an accelerator or incubator, some sponsored by universities themselves, but it is always the same – the assumption that you already have a good idea. And their job is to help you carry it forward and bring it to fruition.\n\nThat is not the goal of this book.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nInnovation should need no introduction. It is the watchword of the day. It is woven into the history of global economic development; just as it is obvious to anyone who has ever tried to make their lives or jobs a little better.",

More frequently, innovation is forced upon us, not just by a competitive marketplace, but by an uncertain, unpredictable, and dynamic world. Unfortunately, too many innovation efforts are consumed by incrementalism, on things that can be measured easily, on “presentism.” Expecting that the world will continue to behave just like it did last quarter or last year is not a realistic assumption. Everybody may want big, disruptive ideas, but instead always seem to chase narrowly focused, “present” ideas, those for which spreadsheets are most easily built and marketing materials most easily designed.\n\nThe events of the last few years have certainly emphasized this point. A 2021 article in *California Management Review* described COVID-19 as “a wake-up call that forced executives to rethink the very foundations of their business” and that they “have come to realize they must organize for dynamic systems by building agile, adaptive and resilient organizations.”[[4]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) Disruptions, whether political, economic, social, or technical are likely to become the “new normal.” Needless to say, recent geo-political events have only emphasized the point:",

    "content": "The methodology that we have created involves two intersecting models. Combined, they offer a structured process, including a wide range of tools, techniques, and templates, to identify problems that are worth solving across increasing horizons of uncertainty (and lengthening time-scales). The result of this process is the creation of a bank of ideas, possibly hundreds of opportunities that can then be evaluated, again in a structured manner, for the best ones. It is important at this point to emphasize that the methodology is domain agnostic and we have used it successfully in both engineering and non-engineering classes from a wide range of disciplines.\n\nThe first model is about the nature of problems. In the English language, the word “problem” is problematic because it can refer to a whole range of problems, and we call all of them “problems.” And it is this confusion that our first model attempts to straighten out. Here is example. The Innovation Hub (based in Norfolk, VA) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) gave a class of ours the following question: “What will the small combat team of the future look like\n” Students found this to be an interesting problem to try to solve, as many of them had grown up playing video games. But there is no way to solve this problem without addressing a “prior” and different kind of problem: “What is the future of war\n”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_unit_tactics#/media/File:Defense.gov_News_Photo_091103-A-1211M-017.jpg",

And different still from the kind of problem that the students actually chose to address: “How can we find a target without GPS\n” Three different kinds of questions, three different kinds of problems, three different time horizons, three different levels of definition.\n\nThe first model, therefore, describes three different kinds of problems across three different time horizons: what is possible, what is plausible, and what is probable; what we have called un-defined, ill-defined, and well-defined problems. Each kind of problem asks different kinds of questions, requires different kinds of tools, different kinds of “solutions,” and different kinds of business cases.\n\nUn-defined problems ask what is possible\n What is over the horizon\n Un-defined problems are concerned with what the future might look like and what we might find there, or not find there.

Well-defined problems are problems as we normally think of them, i.e. what the solution specifically needs to accomplish is clear, even if it is hard, possibly very hard to do.\n\nIll-defined problems, by contrast, ask what is the next big thing for us here, in this specific technological or market space\n The “solution” to an ill-defined problem is a **list of opportunities** because lots of things could serve as the next big thing. The goal, therefore, is to create that list and then figure out what exactly to work on.\n\nAnd lastly, un-defined problems ask questions about what the future might look like and the problems that might be found in alternative futures. This is not a problem in the traditional sense of the word; rather it is **a description of future states** which can be explored for problems worth working on, problems that also help us create a list of opportunities that can then be used to prepare for, or possibly create, a future we want.",

The reality is that you can start the search for opportunities anywhere and then move back and forth across the continuum. For example, just as imagining alternative futures allows us to find problems worth working on, so the solutions to important problems allow us to rethink the future in important ways. The challenge is that we usually treat all problems as if they were well-defined, and then apply the wrong tools.\n\nUn-defined and ill-defined problems cannot be solved in any traditional sense of the term. Rather, they are spaces to explore in order to build a portfolio of opportunities. This famous quote from Linus Pauling will be our guide here:\n\nSIDEBAR ABOUT LINUS PAULING\n\n---\n\n“I’m interested in everything. Lots of things carry over from one field to another. To get good ideas, you have to have a lot of ideas and throw away the bad ones. The knack is to recognize the problems you have some chance of solving.”[[1]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

Your best idea is rarely your first idea, and it rarely grows on a tree. Finding good ideas is hard work, and takes practice. Generating lots of ideas forces us to think broadly across domains and enables us to reach beyond narrow areas of specialization in a complex and uncertain world.\n\nTo summarize, we explore un-defined and ill-defined problems for opportunities, the best of which can then be turned into well-defined problems that can actually be solved. It is only when problems are well-defined that they can be solved in any meaningful sense of the term; for it is only when the problem is well-defined that a solution can be falsified, i.e., it either works or it does not.\n\nBy contrast, ill- and un-defined problems are used to create portfolios of opportunities – the distinction is critical. The difficulty is that all too often we treat all problems as well-defined and use the wrong tools. And an even bigger difficulty is that that the “next big thing” almost always comes from un-defined and ill-defined problems, while the managerial support and funding always come from well-defined problems.",

It is a chance to create a different future. When we ask students, “What makes for a good opportunity\n” the usual answers are impact, feasibility, and personal preference. While certainly valid, as far as it goes, we want to argue that more important are those ideas that take you by surprise, that make you go “whoa” when you hear them, and those where any solution will take advantage of technological and market uncertainty, while minimizing risk.\n\nWhich takes us to the second model comprising our methodology, the relationship between uncertainty and risk. As we have written elsewhere:[[2]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)\n\nRisk is the probability of loss, injury, or other adverse outcome. It can be estimated and calculated based on our knowledge of prior outcomes and conditions. It has been mathematically formulated since the late 17th century, notably in the work of Blaise Pascal. Most importantly, it can be managed. Risk can be distributed (syndicated), insured against, hedged, and reduced. In short, it can be quantified and controlled.",

It represents all of the possible future states of the world at any given time. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the number of possible outcomes, both positive and negative. It is a source of discomfort because we cannot predict it, but it is also a source of potential value. Higher uncertainty means greater potential, and most of us underestimate the extent of that potential since there are more possible future states of the world than we can possibly comprehend.\n\nWhile some view the two as essentially the same and use the words interchangeably, uncertainty is quite distinct from risk, both in its character and in its use. In fact, what sets highly successful entrepreneurs and innovators apart from the rest of the population is the ability to see and use this difference as the basis for their success.",

Entrepreneurs and innovators see value in uncertainty because they earn profits when gains turn out to be appreciably greater than what is generally expected.

For example, early aviation was supported in various ways by government funding until the uncertainty was reduced to a point where companies felt confident enough to make large investments. The risks may have remained large, but the tools existed for managing them.\n\nIn the bottom left (low uncertainty/low risk) is where we find most company R&D departments, as well as student projects and design teams; i.e., small, incremental, sustaining improvements to existing products and markets. As a former student once remarked to us, “The problem here is that corporations spend way too much money and time researching and predicting the present.” As Clayton Christensen showed decades ago, incumbent players dominate incremental improvements because they have the customers and the resources.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

Innovators who want to create “the next big thing” need to work in spaces where there is enough uncertainty in the technology and/or market space that there is no dominant player and, therefore, room for an entrepreneur. If it were obvious, everybody would see it and there would be no opportunity for innovation or above average gains.\n\nInnovation is always a matter of technological and/or market insights; i.e., seeing what others do not see. In other words, all innovation exploits uncertainty to a greater or lesser extent.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) Innovation can take place in any quadrant, but we will focus in this book on the upper left because that is where there is enough uncertainty to offer big opportunities at modest risk.",

Design is a journey *and* a destination. Design thinking is a core way of starting the journey and arriving at the right destination at the right time.\n\nSimply put, “design thinking is a methodology that we use to solve complex problems, and it’s a way of using systemic reasoning and intuition to explore ideal future states,” says McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian. Design thinking, she continues, is “the single biggest competitive advantage that you can have, if your customers are loyal to you—because if you solve for their needs first, you’ll always win.”[[6]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

But in our opinion, such an approach is too “present focused” and too often imagines the future as a continuation of the present, only more so. As important as it is to get out of the building, it is even more important to get out of your own head and start to imagine alternative futures.\n\nAnd so the students began by treating the question as an **un-defined problem**, one that could be explored for opportunities. After talking to officers in the NATO Innovation Hub Medical Branch, the team understood that combat medicine divides into two parts – pre-hospital and hospital. The team decided that they would concentrate on the pre-hospital portion. The next step (after primary and secondary research) was to prepare a scenario analysis, a classic strategy consulting tool. The goal was to develop a 2x2 matrix representing alternative futures, without predicting any particular future. These futures could then be explored for the problems, and thus opportunities, that might be found there. The team made four important assumptions: European location; contested environment; rapid evacuation not possible; kinetic only.",

The next step was to create from this scenario an **ill-defined problem** that could be explored in detail for opportunities: What are the possibilities for field medicine in the future when there are mass casualties in a non-urban environment and where rapid evacuation is not possible. The key assumptions were that the non-urban environment would\n\n- have sparse resources (no hospitals, electricity, etc.);\n- make it easier to distinguish victim/perpetrator; and\n- be reliant on under-resourced medical and non-medical personnel.\n\nIn addition, mass casualties in a non-urban environment presented some critical needs, such as the importance of\n\n- locating multiple distributed victims;\n- prioritizing treatment; and\n- assisting *in situ* (extraction not feasible).\n\nUsing the structured set of tools, techniques, and templates we have designed at Johns Hopkins University, the team spent several months constructing a bank of over 50 ideas, including the following opportunities:",

All fifteen ideas were worth further exploration and, possibly, funding and development.\n\nAs the team reviewed the portfolio, they looked at the relative uncertainty/risk profile of each opportunity, as well as impact and feasibility. In the end, they chose number five, and turned it into a **well-defined problem** that could actually be solved: create a Digital Triage Assistant (DTA) to identify the most severely wounded soldiers in real time and thereby provide life-saving care to those most in need in order to reduce mortality.\n\nFirst responders, emergency rooms, combat medics all have triage processes. The problem is that under the pressures of the moment, these processes can fall apart; pressures that are magnified in a non-urban setting with mass casualties, possibly scattered over a wide area. As was noted in a recent paper, “The use of triage is not well-validated in mass-casualty settings, and in the setting of intentional mass violence, new and innovative approaches are needed.”[[2]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

The device was field tested by the Czech Special Forces, and the project continues.\n\nTo summarize, the DTA is an excellent example of how student teams and organizations can use a structured process for innovation. In this case, undergraduate engineering students at Johns Hopkins, with no medical or military experience, used this process to design and develop a potentially important innovation.\n\nFirst, the team explored un-defined and ill-defined problems to create a portfolio of innovation in a specific domain, i.e. the future of combat medicine.

We innovate in order to solve new problems as well as old problems in new and better ways. But the beginning of the process is always finding the right problems to solve.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins, we have created a model that uses three different kinds of problems, each asking different kinds of questions, requiring different kinds of answers, and using different kinds of tools. Un-defined and ill-defined problems are used to explore alternative futures and different technological and market spaces in order to build a portfolio of opportunities. The best opportunities can then be turned into well-defined problems that can actually be solved.\n\nWe will start in this chapter with un-defined problems. Un-Defined Problems are not problems in the traditional sense of the term, in the sense of looking for a specific solution; rather, they ask what distant futures might look like, what kinds of problems we might find there, and what kinds of opportunities those problems could offer to us today. For example,\n\n- What is the future of personal mobility\n\n- What is the future of work",

Whoever planned anything, whether a hunt or a military campaign or the spring planting, likely thought about alternatives where things might not “go according to plan.” In modern times, scenario planning has been attributed to to “Herman Kahn through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a technique of describing the future in stories as if written by people in the future.”[[4]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) The technique was commonly used by military and geopolitical planners “gaming out” a nuclear exchange.\n\nIn corporate settings, the use of scenario planning was pioneered, and popularized, by Royal Dutch Shell. The goal was to help “policy-makers and firms anticipate change, prepare responses, and create more robust strategies.”[[5]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) The idea was, again, not to predict futures but to prepare for any possible future.",

Frame the challenge.\n2. Gather background information. Think in terms of political, economic, social, technological (PEST).\n3. Identify driving forces; e.g., the most important and most uncertain ones. These driving forces can be thought as the two most prominent trends.\n4.

A group of students were tasked with the following question – “What is the future of US healthcare\n” Using our taxonomy, this is clearly an un-defined problem, and the first thing the students did was to gather background information. They researched the subject and identified key issues and trends, including:\n\n1. The growth of telehealth (i.e., changing methods of delivery)\n2. Changing technology:\n    1.

But this is what they did.\n\nAnd you can see the scenario analysis they constructed using these two axes in the diagram here.\n\nIn short, the team constructed a 2x2 box and generated four scenarios.

In other words, what will the future need to look like to challenge these paradigms\n What will it take to overturn them\n What will need to be true\n What will have to happen\n What new product, services, and policies will need to be created\n\n***Summary***\n\nUn-defined problems give us a chance to explore alternative futures. In this chapter, we have proposed a set of four tools that allow this exploration to be done in a structured manner. The “solution” to an un-defined problem is not a solution in the normal sense of the word, i.e. a product, service, or policy that can be designed and delivered to the market or public. Rather it is an imaginatively constructed space that can be more deeply explored for ill-defined problems and the opportunities that can be discovered there.\n\n[[1]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse",

Our point is that there are different kinds of problems with different time horizons, different degrees of uncertainty and risk, and they cannot be addressed or “solved” in all the same way. Un-defined problems are addressed by exploring possible alternative futures and seeing what kinds of problems might be found there that can be addressed starting today. In other words, we explore un-defined problems by starting with the future and looking backwards; by contrast, we will explore ill-defined problems in the more traditional sense of ***present forward***.\n\nIll-defined problems look at what is **plausible** in a current technology or market space or customer experience in order to find the next big problem worth working on. Many, many opportunities could answer the question, “What’s the next big thing here\n” And so, as with un-defined problems, ill-defined problems help us create a portfolio of innovation.\n\nSIDEBAR ON TYPES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THEIR HISTORY\n\n---",

Rather, we are operating on a shorter time horizon and asking, “What’s the next big thing here, **in this specific space**\n” In the technological space, one obvious answer relates to battery life and size; in the market space, an obvious answer relates to available infrastructure. In short, there is no single answer to the question, “What’s the next big thing for electric vehicles\n” And so we create lists of opportunities, using the tools that we will explore below.\n\nHere is another example. A group of students wanted to do a project focused on Baltimore. One day, they took themselves down to the harbor and were simply horrified by the amount of pollution there. They did not ask, “What is the future of the Baltimore Harbor\n” (clearly an un-defined problem); rather they asked, “How can we clean up the pollution in the harbor\n” The possibilities are near endless, which is one of the things that make this question an ill-defined problem.",

Supplying those constraints is what then allows us to begin building the lists or opportunities that are the “answer” to an ill-defined problem. It is the ability to drive the creation of such lists that represents the true power of ill-defined problems.\n\nThe first thing the students did to address the problem of pollution in the Baltimore Harbor was to supply the missing elements by clarifying what kind of waterway, and what kind of pollution. For example, pollution could mean sewage, domestic effluents, industrial effluents, oil, agricultural runoff, trash, etc. While waterways could mean either the ocean or inland waterways.\n\nThe team decided to focus on how to clean up trash in inland waterways. They then did their research, used some of the tools that we will be presenting in this chapter, and created a list of opportunities (similar to the example of the Digital Triage Assistant above).",

In other words, any solution is now falsifiable – either it works or it does not. A well-defined problem says nothing about how easy or difficult the solution will be to devise and build and disseminate, only what it must deliver.\n\nThey designed and built a robot that used machine learning and computer vision to clean up the harbor – something like a water-based Roomba, but one capable of distinguishing, for example, trash from dead fish. What you see here is the original prototype. The design included plans for automatically emptying the trash, automatically avoiding obstacles, automatically re-charging the battery as needed, and 24/7 use. Long after the team graduated, we saw companies develop this same kind of device.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)\n\nTo summarize, we use ill-defined problems to explore a technological or market space and find the opportunities that are inherent in the situation, some of which can then be turned into well-defined problems that can actually be solved.

    "content": "A good way of thinking about extensive searching comes from a book by Frans Johansson, where he describes “intersectional ideas,” a theory that he developed by asking why the Renaissance was such an extraordinarily creative period. In fact, much of our thinking about techniques for exploring ill-defined problems comes also from our reading of the Renaissance. Johannsson writes that\n\nthe major difference between a directional idea and an intersectional one is that we know where we are going with the former…. Directional innovation improves a product in fairly predictable steps, along a well-defined dimension…. The goal is to evolve an established idea by using refinements and adjustments. The rewards for doing so are reasonably predictable and attained relatively quickly.\n\nIntersectional innovations, on the other hand, change the world in leaps along new directions. They usually pave the way for a new field and therefore make it possible for the people who originated them to become the leaders in the fields they created. Intersectional innovations also do not require as much expertise as directional innovation and can therefore be executed by the people you least suspect.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

Intersectional ideas are where we put two things together **“in** **surprising, unusual, non-obvious, and fascinating ways.”**\n\nThe key is that the combination is unexpected. According to Johansson, this is the way the world has always progressed, and the way technology has always advanced. Everything “new” is really just a new combination of existing ideas; because no “new thing” comes out of nothing.\n\nJust think of the automobile and the smartphone. You can improve a wagon all you want, but you will never get an automobile until you combine it with an internal combustion engine. Just as you can improve a mobile phone all you want, but you will never get a smartphone until you combine your brick of a mobile phone with a computer. Or think of new fields such as computational biology and behavioral economics. Or think of the way that evolutionary theory, originating in the field of biology, has now been applied to all kinds of other fields, including history, economics, and management.\n\nHere is another example: combining an oven with a microwave is old hat, and even combining an oven with air fryers seems kind of obvious nowadays, but what about an oven and a freezer:",

It is hard to explain to undergrads now how much Blockbuster changed our lives. The company did not invent movies, or tape players, or the idea of rent and return. It simply took advantage of all these trends happening “out there” and combined them with the desire of consumers to stay home and watch movies otherwise inaccessible on regular television stations.",

There is an enormous range of thought and opinion in any attempt to define technology, often depending on the discipline under consideration; thus giving rise to problems of focus and degree of specificity.\n\nA good definition of technology comes from John Howells: “knowledge of how to organize people and tools to achieve specific ends.”[[8]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) He then introduces the idea of the technology complex “as a device that relates the general definition of technology to its subdefinitions.”[[9]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)\n\nCritically, Howells states that the “elements within the **technology complex** have been ordered to range from the physical and artifactual to the social and the cultural. This captures the idea that there are multiple ‘levels’ within society at which people organize artifacts to create working technologies. Any or all of these elements be analyzed in a working technology – a technology ‘in use’.”[[10]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21) According to Howells, the technology complex, therefore, includes:",

Big changes lead to what are called technological discontinuities, which create enormous opportunities for innovators. Another way to think about this is in terms of micro-and macro-inventions. Micro-inventions can be explained by basic economics, marketing, and the hunt for capitalist profit. The bigger question is where macro-inventions come from – getting from a wagon to a car cannot be explained by simple economics. Macro-inventions can often be thought of as intersectional ideas (a new combination of things). For example, cars come from combining wagons and internal combustion engines.\n\nIdeas of macro- and micro-inventions can be combined to create a model of technological change, the model you see here. The concept of a dominant design was introduced by James M. Utterback and William J. Abernathy in 1975: “A dominant design is the one that wins the allegiance of the marketplace, the one to which competitors and innovators must adhere if they hope to command significant market following.”[[15]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

But at some point, they begin to fall apart. You can feel it in the air; and that is when enormous opportunities present themselves.\n\nWe get a dominant design in three ways:\n\n1.

But it was hopeless. She could not figure out right and left clicks and was constantly getting lost in the system. I gave up and suffered with her daily phone calls.\n\nIn 2010, the first iPad appeared. And for the life of me, I could not figure out what anybody would do with one. I had a computer and a smartphone and an iPod. I was convinced it was an Apple folly. But it did not disappear into the dumpster of bad products. So one day, I went to the store and got one of the youngsters working there to show me an iPad and how it worked. It slowly dawned on me that this could be the answer. It was intuitive in the sense that you used your finger, not a mouse, and if you got lost, you just hit the home button.\n\nI bought one and took it to my mother. Within a week, she was texting her grandchildren and facetiming with her great-grandchildren every day. She was chatting with women she had gone to nursing school with during World War II and had not seen in decades. She was playing scrabble with strangers all over the world. And had assembled a library of her favorite opera singers from the 1930s.",

As a result of the reverse salient, growth of the entire enterprise is hampered, or thwarted, and thus remedial action is required. The reverse salient usually appears as a result of accidents and confluences that persons presiding over or managing the system do not foresee, or, if they do foresee them, are unable to counter expeditiously. The causes of the lag can arise from within the system; from its environment, or context; or from some complex combination thereof. The reverse salient will not be seen, however, unless inventors, engineers, and others view the technology as a goal-seeking system.\n\n… Innumerable (probably most) inventions and technological developments result from efforts to correct reverse salients .[[1]](https://www.notion.so/PWS-Innovation-Under-Uncertainty-A-Structured-Approach-19f218d946948085a72aff60d559a969\npvs=21)",

Real innovation begins with real problems, problems worth solving, because not all problems are created equal\n      3. What I am really concerned with here is the process – how to bring innovation under analytical control, and get beyond just brainstorming in the local café \n5. Summary\n   1. To summarize, this is a class about innovation; and how to turn innovation into a structured process\n   2. Innovation is about finding problems worth solving, problems that are important to you, and then turning them into opportunities\n   3. Opportunities which can then be turned into new products and services that can actually be built and delivered to the market\n   4. The key paths to finding problems worth solving are \n      1. One, to think differently about the future and the problems that might be found there;\n      2. Two, to exploit change;\n      3. Three, to challenge existing assumptions and paradigms;\n      4. And four, to explore market and technological uncertainty.\n   5. Important, we are not talking about solutions here, i.e. the new products and services that could be delivered to the market, only about the problems worth working on\n   6. Solutions we will deal with next term\n   7. This remainder of the slide deck contains an introduction to the methodology that we have developed at Johns Hopkins and that we will use here in class\n   8. There is no textbook; these slides will function as your textbook and they have been so structured as to act as a resource for you\n   9. In other words, they are not typical corporate slides\n   10. I apologize up front that this slide deck is dominated by lecture as we lay out the theoretical framework for what we will be doing here\n   11.

CHANGE SLIDE\n   4. Both China and the US have massive online markets and they are only getting larger\n   5. Did Covid increase the share of e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales\n - yes, and it is not likely to decrease, as anyone who has seen all the empty malls in America knows\n7. Method 1: Trend Analysis\n   1. One of the most important ways of finding problems worth solving is to learn how to think differently about the future.  Here are two techniques.  We will introduce them briefly today.\n   2. One technique is trend analysis. i.e. carrying a trend to its absurd conclusion and then seeing what you find\n   3. So you could have asked, what if there is no retail at all\n  What will cities look like and what kinds of problems will we find that we can start working on today\n\n1. What will be missing\n\n2.

The second technique for re-imagining the future is what is called scenario analysis\n   2. This is where we create four alternative futures – think of them as stories or science fiction\n   3. The key is to figure out what the axes are\n      1. There is no formula or rule here – whatever seems to work\n   4. And once you have your boxes, they can then be analyzed for what products and services will be needed in that future\n9. Scenario Analysis: E-Commerce\n   1. These were the two axes chosen by my colleague Sascha\n   2. He then created stories in the four boxes, accompanied by pictures\n   3. CHANGE SLIDE\n   4. And then he filled out the stories\n   5. Each represents an alternative future that presents different challenges, uncertainties, and problems; and thus opportunities\n   6. Scenarios give you a chance to ask\n      1.

Back to our subject, why do you want to be an innovator – because you hate your boss, or you want to be the boss; and because you can’t stand doing the same thing over and over \n   2.

Over 15 years ago, I was part of the team that created the Center for Bio-Innovation and Design, CBID, at Hopkins\n      1. It was part of the Bio-Medical Engineering Department (BME), which was itself a joint venture between Engineering and Medicine, and was a rather unique program at its inception\n   3. The idea was to create a graduate level version of the famous undergraduate BME design teams \n   4. Undergraduate design teams worked on projects as presented by Hopkins medical faculty, and all the innovation work was in developing a solution\n   5. By contrast, the idea was that graduate teams would find their own original, innovative projects, which meant starting with finding the right problem\n   6. Students arrived at the beginning of June and then spent the summer observing physicians and surgeons in order to find the next big thing to work on\n8. Example: Getting Out of the Building\n   1. We used a variety of formats, some extensive and some intensive, but they all came down to the same basic idea – get out of the building, go hang out in the Hopkins Hospital, and go see what real people were really struggling with\n   2. In addition to these kinds of structured observations, students heard from experts and lead users\n   3. The goal was, over the summer, build a bank of ideas, hundreds of ideas, and then pick from the best ones to form teams that would actually build out the solution and develop the business case\n   4.

A Structured Process for “Doing Innovation”\n1. As a quick overview, the methodology that we have created involves two intersecting models.  \n2. The first is a structured process, including a wide range of tools, techniques, and templates to identify problems that are worth solving across increasing horizons of uncertainty (and lengthening time-scales).  \n3.

    "content": "1. In English, the word problem is problematic because it can refer to a whole range of problems and we call all of them problems\n2. And it is this confusion that our first model attempts to straighten out\n3. Let me give you an example\n4. A class was asked by NATO to design the small combat team of the future\n5. An amazing problem to address; students loved it; they had all grown up playing video games\n      1. And yet they came up with nothing\n      2. Why\n – because there is no way to think about the small combat team of the future without first thinking about the future of war\n16. A Taxonomy of Problems\n1. Our approach is based on the idea that there are three different kinds of problems across three different time horizons\n1. What is possible, and what is plausible, what is probable \n2. What we have called un-defined, ill-defined, and well-defined\n2. Each kind of problem asks different kinds of questions, requires different kinds of tools, different kinds of “solutions,” and different kinds of business cases.\n17. Examples: Different Kinds of Questions\n   1. Here are some examples, all from the world of prosthetics\n   2. Well-defined problems are problems as we normally think of them\n      1. What the solution needs to accomplish is clear, even if it is hard to do\n   3. Ill-defined problems, by contrast, ask what is the next big thing for us here, in this specific technological or market space\n      1. The “solution” is a list of opportunities because lots of things could serve as the next big thing\n      2. The goal is to create that list and then figure out what exactly to work on\n   4. And lastly, un-defined problems ask questions about what the future will look like\n      1. This is not a problem in the normal sense of the word\n      2. Rather it is a description of future states which can be explored for problems worth working on; \n      3. Problems that help us create a list of opportunities that that can be used to prepare for, or even create, a future we want\n   5. To summarize, only well-defined problems can be solved in the traditional sense of the word because only there can the solution be falsified – it works or it doesn’t\n      1. By contrast, ill- and un-defined problems are used to create portfolios of opportunities – the distinction is critical\n      2. The problem here is that all too often we treat all problems as well-defined and use the wrong tools.\n      3. And an even bigger problem is that that the “next big thing” almost always comes from un-defined and ill-defined problems, while the funding always comes from well-defined problems\n18. Problem Types\n   1. The point is that these three kinds of problems exist on a continuum (hence the dotted lines); and you can start anywhere\n      1. But it is not just the nature of the problems, but the relationships among them that matter as well\n   2. The reality is that you can start anywhere and move back and forth across the continuum\n      1. Just as imagining alternative futures allows us to find problems worth working on, so the solutions to important problems allow us to rethink the future\n   3. The big problem here is that we usually treat all problems as if they were well-defined, and apply the wrong tools\n      1. Un-defined and ill-defined problems cannot be solved in any traditional sense of the term\n      2. Rather, they are spaces to explore in order to build a portfolio of opportunities\n19. The Goal: Finding Lots of Opportunities\n1. This famous quote from Linus Pauling will be our guide here\n2. As many good ideas as we can, across as wide a spectrum as we can, in the hope that a few of them turn out to be really good\n1. Your best idea is rarely your first idea, and it rarely grows on a tree\n2. Finding good ideas is hard work, and takes practice\n   1. Generating lots of ideas forces us to think broadly across domains\n      1. You need to get out of your narrow areas of specialization\n   2. It is a chance for you all to improve the flexibility and agility of your thinking in a complex and uncertain world\n20. Opportunities Are…\n   1. So what is an opportunity",

It can be estimated and calculated based on our knowledge of prior outcomes and conditions. It has been mathematically formulated since the late 17th century, notably in the work of Blaise Pascal. Most importantly, it can be managed. Risk can be distributed (syndicated), insured against, hedged, and reduced. In short, it can be quantified and controlled.\n      4. Uncertainty is different. It is not subject to exact quantification. It was only recently formalized in the early 20th century work of the economist Frank Knight. It represents all of the possible future states of the world at any given time. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the number of possible outcomes, both positive and negative. It is a source of discomfort because we cannot predict it, but it is also a source of potential value. Higher uncertainty means greater potential, and most of us underestimate the extent of that potential since there are more possible future states of the world than we can possibly comprehend.\n      5. While some view the two as essentially the same and use the words interchangeably, uncertainty is quite distinct from risk, both in its character and in its use. In fact, what sets highly successful entrepreneurs and innovators apart from the rest of the population is the ability to see and use this difference as the basis for their success. The good news is that we can learn from them.\n      6. Btw, this distinction is also why most companies want to size existing markets -- if you have heard the expression \"TAM\" or \"SAM\" (total addressable market, or serviceable addressable market), these are measures of existing, known, markets, since one can numerically estimate the current size of these. My corporate clients often ask me to help them estimate these sizes.    \n      7. Entrepreneurs on the other hand discover entirely new markets -- there is no \"addressable market\" until they do what Drucker famously said in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which is, to \"create a customer.\"  Once we know there are customers for, say, hula hoops or carbonated drinks or spreadsheets, only then can we create an estimate of a TAM.\n      8. We manage risk, but exploit uncertainty\n      9. Entrepreneurs and innovators see value in uncertainty since they earn profits when gains are appreciably greater than is generally expected.\n   3. Who plays in each quadrant\n  What kind of problem is being addressed in each quadrant\n – use space as an example for each quadrant\n      1. Top right: governments; defense departments; where the bets are very big and nothing is clear; e.g. hypersonics, quantum computing; and once nuclear energy and space exploration (over the past two decades, over 10,000 space companies have entered what is being called “new space” (article: The new space race could turn science fiction into reality by RANA FOROOHAR)\n      2. Bottom right: big companies; local governments; where the bets are big in markets and technologies that are well-understood; e.g. battery factories; space: SpaceX, Blue Origin, ViaSat\n      3. Bottom left: company R&D departments; small inventors; the usual incremental, sustaining improvements that are necessary to maintain current products and markets – the problem here is that corporations spend way too much time researching and predicting the present\n         1.

We are proposing the generation and curation of a portfolio of ideas, which may exist all over the four quadrants of the Uncertainty - Risk matrix.

Our Work Together\n   1. This is designed to be a two-semester course\n   2. In the first term, we learn how to innovate and as a class we search for problems that are worth solving\n      1.

In a book you can see cited below, Root-Bernstein points out is that innovation is a way of thinking that uses tools such as you see here\n   2. Work your way down the list\n   3. It begins with being able to observe, to see things with new eyes, to see what others do not\n   4. Moves to pattern recognition and analogizing\n   5. And it ends with being able to synthesize disparate points of data and information into a new whole\n   6. Innovative thinking is creative thinking\n34. Creative Thinking is Ordinary Thinking\n   1. Here is a another famous list put together by Robert Weisberg – the phrase “I’m thinking” can really refer to any of the activities on this list\n   2. Creative thinking, therefore, is simply a kind of ordinary thinking and can be constructed from the elements on this list\n35. Learning to Orchestrate Cognitive Components\n   1. In other words, creativity is simply organizing these elements into some sort of order, some sort of structure that allows you to solve the problem at hand\n   2. Or for us, find the problem that is important\n36. Gaining a Broad Perspective\n   1. Critical to the ability to put together these elements, particularly in high-uncertainty domains, is having, or gaining, a broad perspective, not narrow expertise\n   2. And how do we gain this broad perspective",

To remind everyone, innovation is about creating the new – new products, new markets, new ways of working – in order to solve problems, and the key, for you personally of course, is finding the right problems to solve\n   2. At Hopkins, we have created a model that uses three different kinds of problems, each asking different kinds of questions, requiring different kinds of answers, and using different kinds of tools\n   3. Un-defined and ill-defined problems are used to explore alternative futures and different technological and market spaces\n   4. We will use un-defined and ill-defined problems in order to both build a toolkit that can be used to explore specific domains, in order to build a portfolio of opportunities\n   5. We will start with un-defined problems\n2. Un-Defined Problems\n   1. These are not problems in the traditional sense of the term, but ask what distant futures might look like, what kinds of problems we might find there, and what kinds of opportunities those problems could present to us today \n   2. This is a very different kind of question than asking how to fit a square peg into a round hole\n   3. These questions ask you to imagine what the future will look like\n      1.

    "content": "METHOD 2: SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n1. How to Use Scenario Analysis\n   1. Scenario analysis is a second technique we use to think differently about the future\n      1. Again, this is the entire point of un-defined problems\n   2. The key idea here (and really of both techniques) is that we are not predicting what the future will be, but describing alternative possible futures that are rooted in what is actually happening now\n   3. Trend analysis is straightforward – take a trend, carry it forward, and see if anything interesting shows up\n   4. Scenario analysis is different – it is more formal\n      1. It posits a set of possible futures, but attaches no probabilities\n      2. It creates stories along known dimensions \n   5. READ THE SLIDE – this is the way we create scenarios\n2. Not the Nine Box Matrix\n   1. Scenario analysis is not some version of the 9-box matrix, a popular HR tool used to measure employee performance and to identify employees with leadership potential, created by McKinsey in 1970\n      1. It was later adapted by GE to identify key investments and to compare various business units\n      2. The problem is that probability and impact can really only be measured for low uncertainty opportunities\n   2. By contrast, scenario analysis is not a predictive tool, but a descriptive tool by which we create alternative futures that can then be explored for problems and opportunities\n3. Example: The Future of Education\n   1. Let’s take an example\n   2. What is the future of education\n   3. How would you even begin answering that\n      1. One way is a trend analysis – what will the world look like if we never return to traditional classrooms\n      2. Or, what will the world look like if we are all taught by robots\n   4. With scenario analysis, we build four possible, but distinct futures, and then ask what we might find, or not find, there\n   5. The key starting step is choice of axes – you can see several possibilities on the slide\n      1. A good place to get axes is from a trend analysis\n      2. The point is that there is no perfect way to do scenarios – the only good answer is one that you find useful\n   6. Very important – the scenarios need to mirror each other\n4. Scenario Analysis for Education\n   1. These are the two axes that we chose – delivery method (virtual or in-person) and method of instruction (a real teacher or a robot with AI)\n   2. You will notice that scenarios are given descriptive names, usually accompanied by pictures\n5. Descriptions of the Scenarios\n   1. The next step is to actually write the descriptions\n   2. In general, this would require real research and an analysis of current trends\n   3. Extremely important – the scenarios need to mirror each other, i.e. the same kind of stuff needs to be in each box\n6. Opportunities from Scenario Analysis\n   1. The last step is to then search each scenario for the interesting problems that might be found in such a future – take a look at the ones on the slide\n   2. Problems are, of course, opportunities; and the key is to find the most interesting opportunities that could actually be started today\n   3. A simple way of thinking about this is to ask what kinds of products and services and policies will be needed if this future comes to pass",

Here is a random example I found online, talking about how to reduce smoking in a population\n      1. Interventions to reduce smoking go can be at the level of the individual, or the community that the individual is part of, all the way to entire populations\n   3. Similarly, we could start thinking about the future of submarines by situating them within a nested hierarchy\n      1. All the way from the hundred or so elements and sub-systems of a submarine to national policy and strategy\n4. Another Example\n   1. Here is another example of systems structure and nested hierarchies\n   2. These levels, their interconnections, and the purpose of the entire system give us a way of exploring not just elements, but their interconnections, and even alternative futures for the system as a whole\n   3. They also give us a way of connecting un-defined with ill-defined problems\n      1. For example, a way of tying together what the future of the system might look like with what’s the next big in any part of the hierarchy\n5. My Favorite Example\n   1. And my favorite example\n6.

    "content": "ILL-DEFINED PROBLEMS\n1. Problem Types\n   1. Innovation begins with finding problems worth solving\n   2. Our point is that there are different kinds of problems with different time horizons, different degrees of uncertainty and risk, and they cannot be addressed or “solved” in all the same way\n      1. Un-defined problems are addressed by exploring possible futures and seeing what kinds of problems might be found there that can be addressed starting today\n   3. Ill-defined problems are still traditional in the sense that they are present forward; by contrast, un-defined problems are future backward\n2. Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. Ill-defined problems look at what is plausible in a technology or market space or customer experience in order to find the next big problem worth working on\n      1. The point is that many, many things could answer the question, “What’s the next big thing\n”\n   2. And like un-defined problems, ill-defined problems help us create a portfolio of innovation\n3. Example: What’s Next Big Thing for Electric Vehicles\n   1. Ill-defined problems are not about imagining distant futures, but operate on a shorter time horizon and ask “What’s the next big thing here, in this specific space\n”\n   2. For example, the question on this slide is not “What’s the future of electric vehicles\n” but what’s the next big thing for anyone who will use or manufacture them\n4. Example: Baltimore Harbor\n1. Here is an example\n2. It all began when students went down to the Baltimore Harbor and were shocked by the amount of pollution they saw there; and decided they wanted to do something \n3. Let’s be clear – they did not ask about future state of the harbor\n   1. Rather, the question they asked themselves was how to clean up pollution in waterways\n   2. The possibilities are near endless\n5. Framing an Ill-Defined Problem\n1. Which is what makes it an ill-defined problem – there is no single solution for the simple reason that there is no clearly defined problem yet that can be solved\n1. Something is missing; something is needed to constrain the problem\n2. Supplying those constraints is what then allows us to begin building the lists that are the “answer” to an ill-defined problem\n2. It is the ability to drive the creation of such lists that represents the true power of ill-defined problems (as well as un-defined problems)\n1. And from that list you pick the ones you want to work on\n6. The Process for Creating an Ill-Defined Problem\n   1. So the first thing the students did to address this ill-defined space was to supply the missing elements by clarifying what kind of waterway, and what kind of pollution\n   2. They decided to focus on trash in inland waterways\n   3. And then they made lists of opportunities using a set of tools and techniques\n   4. And the lists were quite extensive – similar to the DTA example on the first day\n7. The Solution\n   1. Then they picked one opportunity and turned it into a well-defined problem\n   2. In this case – how to continuously clean up trash from inland waterways with minimal human intervention and oversight\n – what you see here\n   3. They designed and built a robot that uses AI and computer vision to clean up the harbor – something like a water-based Roomba\n      1. This is a well-defined problem because whatever solution they built either worked or it did not – the solution was falsifiable\n8. The PixieDrone\n1. And, of course, they were years ahead of their time – there are now lots of companies out there chasing the students’ idea, for example the one you see here\n2. Over the years, our students have probably left hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funding on the table from all the good ideas they have chosen not to pursue\n9. Summary: Using Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. To summarize, ill-defined problems are very different from un-defined problems\n      1. They do not ask about future states in a very uncertain world, but simply what is plausibly the next big thing inherent in this particular situation\n      2. And the key is that there is no single answer; in fact, many things could actually address the “problem”\n      3. Hence, we make lists\n   2. Like un-defined problems, ill-defined problems can help us create a bank of interesting opportunities\n      1. From which we can then select the best ones and turn them into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n10. Tools for Exploring Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. So how do we actually explore ill-defined problems – through a combination of intensive and extensive searching of market and technological spaces\n   2. I will give you some tools for going about all this",

A good way of thinking about extensive searching comes from a book by Frans Johansson, where he describes “intersectional ideas,” a theory that he developed by asking why the Renaissance was such an extraordinarily creative period\n12. Intersectional Ideas\n   1. Johansson claims that there are two kinds of ideas:\n   2. Directional ideas are where we know where we are going, and\n   3. Intersectional ideas, where we don’t know where we are going, and are often the product of serendipity\n13. Characteristics\n   1. Intersectional ideas are where we put two things together in surprising, unusual, non-obvious, and fascinating ways.\n   2. The key is that the combination is unexpected\n      1. But this is the way the world has always progressed, and the way technology has always advanced\n      2. Everything “new” is really just a new combination of existing ideas; because no “new thing” comes out of nothing\n   3. Examples:\n      1. Computational biology\n      2. Behavioral economics\n      3. Evolutionary theories of technological development\n      4. Fusion cooking\n      5. The smart phone\n14. Example: Celcy\n   1. Or this example from a student project that is now a real company – they combined a freezer and an oven\n15. How to Make Barriers Fall\n   1. The question is how to create intersectional ideas\n   2. Here are some examples\n   3. This is what companies try to do all the time by forcing people from different parts of the organization to meet and talk, and then wait to see what comes out of it\n16. The Process\n   1. Now you try it – put two things together that have never before been put together\n   2. Start with one thing that you care deeply about and then combine it with a wide range of other ideas, and see what you come up with\n   3. What are the opportunities",

Insight in the sense of seeing what others do not see\n18. Four Lenses\n   1. And where do these insights come from\n\n2. From the four lenses you see here\n   3.

We will begin looking for a great problem to solve by asking what’s changing – the first of Gibson’s four lenses\n      1. The key is that macro-trends out there change things\n      2. Change always wrecks things, and always creates opportunities, often as a result of the wrecking\n   2. This view of changes is different from before, \n      1. We are not carrying trends to their absurd conclusion, but simply asking what might be the next big thing to come out of this trend that we can plausibly take advantage of now\n   3. For example, Amazon began by asking what was next for the internet\n      1. Jeff Bezos was a banker, and what he noticed was that internet usage was growing by thousands of percentages a month\n      2. All he wanted was to take advantage of that trend\n      3.

    "content": "24. The Technology Complex\n   1. Let’s look at one category of changes in more detail – technology and science\n   2. First it must be remembered that technology is not a simple thing, but represents a complex\n   3. Think of all that is involved in using an induction stove, or a solar panel, or an electric vehicle, or tele-medicine\n25. Technological Transitions\n   1. As these complexes change over time, they undermine the competitive advantages of existing firms\n26. Diminishing Returns\n   1. But as technologies mature, they experience ever diminishing returns\n27. Technology S-Curves\n   1. Technological changes and transitions can be thought of as s-curves, where improvement in the technology per unit of input diminishes over time\n   2. In other words, technological improvement runs up against barriers, either physical or market, and that is when opportunities for disruptive innovations present themselves\n   3. So here is the question, where are technologies reaching their limit\n \n      1. For example, how much more power can they build into your phone before you stop caring, and stop wanting to pay for it\n28. The Innovation Window\n   1. Here is a nice diagram I found that ties s-curves to the product life cycle\n   2. As each stage reaches some sort of maturity, the need for product innovation becomes ever more evident\n   3. Take computers for an example – mainframes to minis to desktops to laptops to whatever – as technologies and markets change\n29. Example\n   1. And another example for you\n30. An Evolutionary Process\n   1. In other words, technological change can be thought of as an evolutionary process where a long series of small changes is abruptly ended by a big change\n31. Technological Discontinuities and Dominant Design\n   1. Big changes lead to what are called technological discontinuities, which create enormous opportunities for innovators\n32. Macro and Micro-Inventions\n   1. Another way to think about this is in terms of micro-and macro-inventions\n   2. Micro-inventions can be explained by basic economics and marketing\n      1. Who wins at micro-changes – incumbent players\n      2. Who often wins at macro-changes – disruptive companies\n   3. The real question is where macro-inventions come from – you can improve a wagon all you want, but you will never get a car.  \n      1. Macro changes are often intersectional ideas (a new combination of things)\n      2. For example, cars come from combining wagons and internal combustion engines.\n33. Dominant Designs\n1. Macro- and micro-changes can be combined in the model you see here\n   1. Technological change can be thought of as an evolutionary process where a long series of small changes is abruptly ended by a big change\n2. Big changes lead to what are called technological discontinuities, which ultimately create what are called dominant designs\n3. So what is a dominant design",

    "content": "Understanding Needs – What’s Next for a User Experience\n43. This class we will look for the next great problem to solve by asking what opportunities unsatisfied user experiences offer us, another of Gibson’s four lenses\n44. Example: Warby Parker\n   1. They were JHU grads and completely reimagined how we can buy glasses\n   2. Which industry assumptions did they question; and which technological and social trends did they take advantage of (e.g., the changing nature of how we buy)\n   3. They did not invent either glasses or ordering things online\n      1. All they did was change the user experience, and that changed everything\n45. Example: Casper\n   1. They completely reimagined how we can buy mattresses\n   2. Which industry assumptions did they question; and which technological and social trends did they take advantage of (e.g., the changing nature of how we buy)\n   3. Again, all this seems obvious, but only in retrospect\n46. Example: Improving the User Burrito Experience\n   1. The list of user experiences that can be explored is endless\n      1. Big stuff like how we interact with government or physicians\n      2. Or little stuff, like how we interact with burritos (I could not resist this – they were students of mine)\n   2. But it starts by looking around and seeing the world and our lives with new eyes\n      1. As Warren Berger wrote, as if we were seeing the world for the first time; just like little kids\n47. Process Mapping\n   1. A critical tool here is process mapping (which is what the burrito team did)\n   2. Writing down what users do step by step\n   3. And then ranking how important each step is to you against how satisfied you are\n      1. Where are the opportunities – high importance and low satisfaction \n48. Example: Intralox\n   1. This example comes forma company that we worked with\n   2. The company designs specialized conveyor belts for soft packaging\n   3. The innovation team designed a new product offering and were convinced that they were going to walk away with first prize at the big logistics and material handling conference\n      1. They didn’t even get an honorable mention\n      2. The companies that won are on the top left\n      3. You will notice that they are almost all robotics companies\n   4. So what the team at Intralox did was combine some ideas about dominant designs (the list in the middle) with process mapping in the space that they play in, i.e. bulk parcel management (in yellow) and then see where robots currently play in their space of gravity belts\n   5. What the analysis showed was the space for opportunity for them to move further back in the value chain, rather than just their traditional offerings at the very end\n49. The Advantage of Process Maps\n   1. Process maps allow you visualize what could be eliminated or combined\n   2. And what kinds of new problems could be identified and then addressed\n   3.

Not just a matter of a new thing, but how things create new meanings in our lives.\n   2. Examples include Instagram, Waze\n   3. Or how creams and lotions and spas are now part of self-care, rather than just having soft skin\n   4. Or going to a doctor – change from annual physical to managing my old age\n   5. This is not only about changing the thing itself but about changing the terms of competition to create new meaning\n103. Look Beyond Features and Functions\n   1. Again, you need to look beyond features and functions to the role that such a product or service could play in our lives\n104. People Do Not Buy Products, They Buy Meaning\n   1. Think about it, isn’t this what we really want\n   2. Not things, but meaning in our lives\n105. Give People a New Reason to Buy\n   1. Bottom line – Verganti’s point is that a key to innovation is giving people a new reason to buy\n   2. Which to use our language means challenging existing paradigms and changing the terms of competition\n106. Layers of Meaning\n   1. It is also important to remember that there are different kinds of meanings, and innovation can occur in any level\n107. Example: Peleton\n   1. Peleton is a stationary bike and a computer; a nice bike but nothing new\n   2. What terms of competition did it change",

What we are going to do in this section is take a look at how the toolkit can be expanded and applied to specific domains, starting with what are know as reverse salient\n   2. The term comes from the famous book by Thomas Hughes on the history of electrification in the industrialized world, and specifically the US\n   3. Electricity only begins in the 1880s, specifically to light streets, houses, and buildings\n   4. The power plants are small and the distribution is limited\n   5. The question that he sets out to answer is how these small, local systems morphed into regional inter-connected systems\n   6.

    "content": "1. This is a picture of electricity generation in Pennsylvania in 1900\n   2. You can see how it is dominated by local generation\n4. The System in 1930\n   1. And this is a picture of how the system looked in 1930 – completely different\n   2. Something like Andy Groves’ picture of the change in the computer industry between 1980 and 1995\n   3. The system that you see here was the ultimate answer to the key problem facing electricity systems in the 1880s – the problem of costly transmission beyond a few miles\n5. The Idea of a Reverse Salient\n   1. Hughes analyzes this problem in terms of what he calls a reverse salient\n   2. He takes the term from military affairs where a group of soldiers advance beyond their own lines and create a salient or bulge that leaves them exposed to attack from three sides\n   3. A reverse salient is the opposite – one group of soldiers cannot advance, thus holding up the progress of the entire army\n   4. Hughes uses this idea to analyze the progress of electrification, where the progress of the entire system is held up at a specific point, i.e. the high cost of transmission\n   5. He claims that identifying the reverse salient is the key to the creative process, in the sense that it serves as the focus for innovative and inventive activity\n   6. And if this reverse salient is solved, you can be sure that another one will appear\n6. Reverse Salient: The High Cost of Transmission\n   1. Here is his famous diagram of the process of electrification\n7. Correcting Reverse Salients\n   1. Correcting a reverse salient means allowing it to advance (think job to be done) and brings it “back into line” with the rest of the system\n   2. Which then allows the entire system to advance; meaning the progress of electrification across America\n8. One Answer: Change the System\n   1. In the case of electrification, how was this done\n   2. Basically by changing the entire system from DC to AC \n9. Solving the Reverse Salient\n   1. This simple diagram illustrates the change\n   2. AC allowed for the solution of the critical problem, i.e. the high cost of transmission\n10. AC Also had Reverse Salients\n   1. But as always in this world, solving a problem creates a new set of problems\n   2. AC also had its reverse salient – in this case the lack of a practical motor, not to mention the problems cause by higher voltages for insulation and safety\n   3. And not to mention the idea that different kinds of consumers needed different voltages\n11. The Solution\n   1. So the solution we ended up with is what we call a universal system where there is one power generating plant that sends electricity all over the area and all consumers can use it, despite their very different needs\n12. Westinghouse Concept of a Universal Supply System\n   1. This was the solution as devised b Westinghouse\n13. The Solution\n   1. And this is kind of how the system looks now\n14. The Process\n   1. These are the steps for actually using reverse salient – pretty straightforward\n   2. The bigger question is how you go about addressing the reverse salient – here are some of the tools that we believe could help\n15. Examples\n   1. So what domains “out there” are confronting clear reverse salient\n   2. Here is a list prepared by Alexander Rovalino\n16. Case Study – Genomics\n   1. And here is a case study he prepared for you by Alexander\n   2. DNA was discovered in 1871, but it took until 1977 before we sequenced each gene that makes up a single virus for the first time: a full genome. \n      1. The first human genome was completed in 2003 at the cost of 2.7 billion dollars. \n      2. Since then, the technology has improved to the point that it costs less than one thousand dollars and takes less than a day to sequence a genome. \n   3. Today, Illumina dominates the sequencing market, while a number of startups are trying to break their monopoly. \n   4. How did the price of sequencing drop so dramatically\n \n      1. Initial technologies, such as Sanger sequencing, were slow, costly, inaccurate, and generated small amounts of data. \n      2. Like earlier computing technology, advancement was limited by the size of the machine and its serial nature. \n      3. Next-generation-sequencing was introduced to overcome these challenges, using parallel processing and novel chemistry to bring sequencing up to the level of other innovations in computer chips and data storage and analytics. \n      4. It is anticipated that further gradual improvements in sequencing technology will unlock sub-$100 genomes and lead to better disease diagnoses and more personalized medical treatments.\n17. Case Study – Fossil Fuels\n   1. The exploitation of oil and gas has existed for over one thousand years, but the modern oil industry began with wells drilled in the mid-19th century. \n      1. Demand for fuel was driven in large part by the automobile and manufacturing industries. \n      2. At the beginning of the 20th century, natural gas became a viable product that burns cleaner than oil. \n      3. Today, a number of major private and state-owned companies dominate the global oil and gas trade.\n   2. As traditional oil fields were depleted, producers looked for new ways to extract oil and gas to maintain their supplies. \n   3. Although massive shale fields had been identified as potential sources of these resources, drilling technology was critically limited: it could not pump oil or gas through the dense rock. \n      1. Once engineers determined an effective way to fracture the shale to allow oil and gas to pass through (fracking), the technology caught up with other breakthroughs, like horizontal drilling, that allowed companies to take full advantage of shale fields. \n      2. Today, the technology is so successful that it is expected that demand for fossil fuels will run out long before the resources themselves do.",

Both are designed to visually display cause and effect relationships\n8. We are Always Embedded in a Larger System\n   1. As we saw earlier when looking at nested hierarchies, it is important to remember that whatever we are working on is embedded in a larger system\n   2. Our decisions are determined not only by the goals we have set, but by the goals and actions of others, as well as the side effects of both our own decisions and the action of others\n   3. Important – a systems map should make visual the distinction between intended actions and unintended consequences\n9. The Building Blocks: Feedback Loops  \n   1. All casual loop diagrams are constructed from two building blocks:\n      1. Reinforcing loops – positive feedback loops; the change in one direction compounds \n      2. Balancing loops which generate stability as they counteract the effects of reinforcing loops\n10. Directions of Change\n   1. In other words, reinforcing loops and balancing loops have directions – same and opposite\n   2. Same means the second variable moves in the same direction as the first variable\n   3. Opposite means the second variable moves in the opposite direction as the first variable\n   4. WORK THROUGH EXAMPLES ON SLIDE\n11. Example\n   1. Here is another small example\n   2. Notice how the goal comes from outside the loops\n12. Example\n   1. And here is another example\n   2. WORK THROUGH EXAMPLES ON SLIDE (start with the R loop)\n   3. Reinforcing loops generate growth and collapse, in which the growth or collapse continues at an ever-increasing rate. A small change builds on itself, resulting in big changes after some time.\n   4. Balancing loops generate stability. Balancing processes generate the forces of resistance, which eventually limit growth.\n13. You Try It – Where are the S’s and O’s",

And then from those diagrams identified a set of leverage points\n   2.

A chance to fix something that does not work as it should\n   2. A chance to create a new future\n   3. In other words, it is any un- or ill-defined problem that offers up something interesting enough that can be turned into a well-defined problem that can actually be solved, and hopefully used to create a better future\n   3. Creating a Portfolio of Opportunities\n   1. One way to think about this idea of a portfolio comes from an interesting article published by McKinsey some years back\n   2. They argued that companies need to create a portfolio of innovation to reflect different time horizons\n   1. Now – make existing products better, faster cheaper; what we have called presentism – the problem is that this where the funding always is\n   2. New – what is the next product or service we can offer the market\n   3. Next – let’s disrupt our own business before competitors do\n   3. Think about it in terms of coffee\n   1. Now – how can we improve the taste of our leading brand of coffee\n   2. New – what new ways of brewing coffee can we develop\n   3. Next – what will replace coffee altogether\n   4. This makes perfect sense in a corporate environment – like our risk/uncertainty matrix, companies need to be playing across time and uncertainty horizons\n   4. Now: Incremental Improvements\n   1. Now is about small changes, incremental improvements, to keep customers engaged and buying\n   5. New: Ansoff Matrix\n   1. The simplest way to think about new is in terms of the Ansoff Matrix\n   2. New products and service offerings and new market segments\n   6. The Goal: Next Opportunities\n   1. But our goal in this class is neither Now nor New, but Next\n   2. Not small improvements, and adjacent markets, but the next big thing that will help create a different future\n   3. And in corporate environments, too little attention is paid to creating these types opportunities\n   7. Where are the Best Opportunities",

Uncertainty always dissipates over time; and so it is uncertainty that gives entrepreneurs their chance, while others wait for the future to become clear\n   8. Exercise: Creating a Portfolio of Opportunities\n   1. Your task now is to look back over the term and use the ideas you have generated (or completely different ones) to create a portfolio of opportunities, things that are interesting enough (validated) to turn into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n   2. And then from your portfolio, which one would you pick to work on first\n   3. In other words, what is your best opportunity\n\n1.

    "content": "WELL-DEFINED PROBLEMS\n   1. Reminder: Problem Types\n   1. To repeat, innovation begins with finding problems worth solving\n   2. Those problems could be anything from the need to make small changes to a product, to identifying the company’s next blockbuster product, to how to take advantage of big changes occurring out there, to how wildly unpredictable futures could provide opportunities in the years to come\n   3. The first point is that these are all different kinds of problems\n   1. They exist on a continuum (hence the dotted lines), with different time horizons, different degrees of uncertainty, and they cannot all be addressed or “solved” in the same way\n   2. Un-defined problems are addressed by imagining different futures\n   3. Ill-defined problems are addressed by making lists, by trying to figure out what is the next big thing\n   4. They both help us build a portfolio of opportunities\n   4. But once you have the portfolio, the best ones need to be turned into well-defined problems so they can actually be solved\n   1. Which are the best ones\n – there is no formula\n   2. If the best ones are highly uncertain, then the traditional tools for prioritizing projects, such as DCF, will not help us much\n   3. So pick the ones that call your name\n   2. An Important Well-Defined Problem\n   1. Again, the goal now is to turn the best of the portfolio into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n   1. Being well-defined says nothing about the particular solution, which may be easy to come by or hard; think about radar and sonar\n   2. Only what the solution needs to deliver\n   3. There are no lists here – only something that works or does not\n   2. Look at these examples – they were all extremely important problems, and not hard to find\n   1. Finding submarines – sonar\n   2. Finding bombers and massing fighters against them – radar \n   3. Quickly creating gunnery tables for artillery – computers\n   3. For these well-defined problems, the solution criteria were clear from the start, but incredibly difficult to find\n   3. Well-Defined Problems\n   1. Well-defined problems begin as opportunities, whether the clear sense that something does not work as it should or the idea that the future will be a very different kind of place where we will face very different kinds of problems\n   2. But whatever it is, all well-defined problems have falsifiable, specific, solutions\n   4. Formulating a Well-Defined Problem\n   1. Well-defined problems can be thought of as stories\n   2. One way to craft stories and to make sure you have all of the key elements is to use the five W’s\n   1. Just like you did in elementary school when they taught you how to read a newspaper\n   3.

Problems can be disaggregated into processes or components\n   2. So which comes first – definition or disaggregation – it is an iterative process\n   16. MECE\n   1. The key here is MECE\n   2. That the components need to be mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive\n   1. The first is clear, the second not always so\n   17. Issue Trees\n   1. Issue trees are a must tool for doing MECE, for taking apart any problem so that you can solve it\n   2. DO THE EXAMPLE\n   3.

    "content": "Peter Thiel’s View\nUnder perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit. The opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits. \n…by “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: it hasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself from Microsoft and Yahoo! \nEvery monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.\nAs a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. \nEvery startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is.",

Later in a project, we often challenge those constraints, but it’s important to understand current perceptions. \nObserve real people in real-life situations to find out what makes them tick: what confuses them, what they like, what they hate, where they have latent needs not addressed by current products and services\nVisualize new-to-the-world concepts and the customers who will use them. Some people think of this step as predicting the future, and it is probably the most brainstorming-intensive phase of the process. Quite often, the visualization takes the form of a computer-based rendering or simulation, though IDEO also builds thousands of physical models and prototypes every year. For new product categories we sometimes visualize the customer experience by using composite characters and storyboard-illustrated scenarios. In some cases, we even make a video that portrays life with the future product before it really exists. \nEvaluate and refine the prototypes in a series of quick iterations. We try not to get too attached to the first few prototypes, because we know they’ll change. No idea is so good that it can’t be improved upon, and we plan on a series of improvements. We get input from our internal team, from the client team, from knowledgeable people not directly involved with the project, and from people who make up the target market. We watch for what works and what doesn’t, what confuses people, what they seem to like, and we incrementally improve the product in the next round. \nImplement the new concept for commercialization. This phase is often the longest and most technically challenging in the development process, but I believe that IDEO’s ability to successfully implement lends credibility to all the creative work that goes before.",

Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions. We’ve also found that the best topic statements focus outward on a specific customer need or service enhancement rather than focusing inward on some organizational goal. \nPLAYFUL RULES  Don’t start to critique or debate ideas. \nNUMBER YOUR IDEAS  We’ve found that a hundred ideas per hour usually indicates a good, fluid brainstorming session. \nBUILD AND JUMP  Try building on an idea. Encourage another push or introduce a small variation. Or take a jump, either back to an earlier path you skipped by too quickly or forward to a completely new approach. Whatever you do, try to get into the next power curve and keep the energy up,\nTHE SPACE REMEMBERS  Great brainstorm leaders understand the power of spatial memory. Write the flow of ideas down in a medium visible to the whole group. \nSTRETCH YOUR MENTAL MUSCLES  One type of warm-up we practice is a fast-paced word game simply to clear the mind…. Another warm-up is to do some content-related homework. \nGET PHYSICAL  Good brainstorms are extremely visual. They include sketching, mind mapping, diagrams, and stick figures. \nConfidential for classroom use only\n61",

That you need to think “outside the box” to be truly original and innovative. That you should start with a problem and then “brainstorm” ideas without restraint until you find a solution. That you should “go wild” making analogies to things that have nothing to do with your products, services, or processes. That straying as far afield as possible will help you come up with a breakthrough idea. We believe just the opposite. \nWe’ll show you that more innovation— and better and quicker innovation— happens when you work inside your familiar world (yes, inside the box) using what we call templates. …the majority of new, inventive, and successful products result from only five templates: \nsubtraction, \ndivision, \nmultiplication, \ntask unification, and \nattribute dependency. \nThese templates form the basis of the innovation method called Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT).\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n63",

Innovative products and services often have had something removed, usually something that was previously thought to be essential to the product or service. \nDIVISION.  Many creative products and services have had a component divided out of them and placed somewhere else in the usage situation, usually in a way that initially seemed unproductive or unworkable. \nMULTIPLICATION.  With this technique, a component has been copied but changed in some way, usually in a way that initially seemed unnecessary or odd. \nTASK UNIFICATION.  With some creative products and services, certain tasks have been brought together and unified within one component of the product or service— usually a component that was previously thought to be unrelated to that task. \nATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY.  In many innovative products and services, two or more attributes that previously seemed unrelated now correlate with one another.

We’ve actually introduced it to you already: the notion that the best and fastest way to innovate is to look at resources close at hand. \nThe second principle requires retraining how your brain thinks about problem solving. Most people assume that the way to innovate is to start with a well-defined problem and then try to think of solutions. In our method, it is just the opposite. We start with an abstract, conceptual solution and then work back to the problem that it solves. Therefore, we have to learn how to reverse the usual way our brain works when innovating.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n65",

It’s not to always come up with the best solution to a problem at hand. Sometimes the best solution to a problem can actually be found outside the box. But if your goal is to systematize creativity, you have to operate within the confines of the Closed World. That is key. \n…by limiting the number of variables under consideration from infinity to a finite number, we amplify our potential to come up with a creative solution. Why\n Such limits boost the creative process, allowing individuals to be more focused. \nPerhaps when people eliminate resources and pare down their problem world to its basic elements, they tap into their own natural resourcefulness. \nCreativity is really about an intelligent search among a limited list of possibilities, rather than random, long-distance outward leaps and bounds. This, then, is our first rule: look inside! \nConfidential for classroom use only\n67\n\nThe Process\nChallenge assumptions and what we take for granted.  \nIdentify a problem and its current solution.  \nDetermine if an opportunity exists by\nTaking something away\nAdding something\nMoving an element\nLinking the elements in unique ways, either internally or to something external\nMove the pieces of the puzzle around.",

Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) take a lot of the challenge out of this sometimes-nerve-wracking event. \nIn fact, on slippery surfaces, even professional drivers can't stop as quickly without ABS as an average driver can with ABS.\nThe theory behind anti-lock brakes is simple. A skidding wheel (where the tire contact patch is sliding relative to the road) has less traction than a non-skidding wheel. If you have been stuck on ice, you know that if your wheels are spinning you have no traction. This is because the contact patch is sliding relative to the ice. \nBy keeping the wheels from skidding while you slow down, anti-lock brakes benefit you in two ways: You'll stop faster, and you'll be able to steer while you stop.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n9\nhttps://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/anti-lock-brake.htm\nSolving a well-defined problem can also open up new possibilities.\n9\n\nExample: How Can MLB Regain its Popularity",

Mind maps are used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, decision making, and writing.\nThe elements of a given mind map are arranged intuitively according to the importance of the concepts, and are classified into groupings, branches, or areas, with the goal of representing semantic or other connections between portions of information. Mind maps may also aid recall of existing memories.\nBy presenting ideas in a radial, graphical, non-linear manner, mind maps encourage a brainstorming approach to planning and organizational tasks. Though the branches of a mind map represent hierarchical tree structures, their radial arrangement disrupts the prioritizing of concepts typically associated with hierarchies presented with more linear visual cues. This orientation towards brainstorming encourages users to enumerate and connect concepts without a tendency to begin within a particular conceptual framework.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n14",

    "content": "The Rules of Mind Mapping\nThe rules of mind mapping are “intended to help you to a free and good judgment.” They are “the children of sound experience,” having been extensively tested and refined over the past thirty years. \nAll you need to begin mind mapping is a topic, a few colored pens, and a large sheet of paper. Follow these rules: \nBegin your mind map with a symbol or a picture (representing your topic) at the center of your page. Starting at the center opens your mind to a full 360 degrees of association. Pictures and symbols are much easier to remember than words and enhance your ability to think creatively about your subject. \nWrite down key words. Key words are the information-rich “nuggets” of recall and creative association. \nConnect the key words with lines radiating from your central image. By linking words with lines (“branches”), you’ll show clearly how one key word relates to another. \nPrint your key words. Printing is easier to read and remember than writing. \nPrint one key word per line. By doing this, you free yourself to discover the maximum number of creative associations for each key word. The discipline of one word per line also trains you to focus on the most appropriate key word, enhancing the precision of your thought and minimizing clutter. \nPrint your key words on the lines and make the length of the word the same as the line it is on. This maximizes clarity of association and encourages economy of space. \nUse colors, pictures, dimension, and codes for greater association and emphasis. Highlight important points and illustrate relationships between different branches of your mind map. You might, for instance, prioritize your main points through color coding, highlighting in yellow the most important points, using blue for secondary points, and so forth. Pictures and images, preferably in vivid color, should be used wherever possible; they stimulate your creative association and greatly enhance your memory.",

A key concept or problem is drawn in the center and a collection of relevant topics is arranged in a radial structure about this concept or problem. \nStep 1: Define the main concept or problem. Identify the main concept or problem one would like to explore using a short phrase or sentence. One can also add a drawing or picture to represent the concept or the problem at hand. \nStep 2: Define the primary branches. Create as many primary branches needed which directly relate to the main concept or problem, placing them in a radial hierarchy structure. Choosing the “right” primary branches is important, as this will facilitate the thinking at lower levels of the hierarchy. If these primary branches are too general or too specific, they may constrain ones’ thinking and creativity. \nStep 3: Define the sub‐branches. Create as many sub‐branches as needed. Sub‐branches stem from the primary branches in order to further expand a given concept. This process may continue until one reaches the desired level of granularity.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n21\nAvner Engel.

(Fifth why, a root cause)\nThe questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause. \nThe key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect through any layers of abstraction to a root cause that still has some connection to the original problem. \nNote that, in this example, the fifth why suggests a broken process or an alterable behaviour, which is indicative of reaching the root-cause level.\nIt is interesting to note that the last answer points to a process. This is one of the most important aspects in the 5 Why approach - the real root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist. Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower. These answers may be true, but they are out of our control. Therefore, instead of asking the question why\n, ask why did the process fail",

Although chains of association have huge benefits, they also carry costs. They inhibit our ability to think broadly.\nIn the search for intersections, low barriers provide an advantage. The problem is that there are strong benefits to keeping our natural cognitive barriers in place. Our brain evolved the way it did for a reason. It generally enjoys finding order in things, grouping concepts together, and finding structure in the environment surrounding it. A person with high associative barriers will quickly arrive at conclusions when confronted with a problem sine their thinking is more focused.

The magnitude of the technological change is important. The larger the technological change, the greater the opportunity for new businesses to be created because larger magnitude changes affect more uses for technology, allowing the use of new technology in more things. \nWhy do political and regulatory changes enhance entrepreneurial opportunity\n Deregulation creates opportunity because it allows more variance in ideas to be put forward by entrepreneurs who might have been barred from entry under a regulated regime. \nSocial and demographic changes open up opportunities for new technology businesses by altering people's preferences and creating demand for things where demand had not existed before. \nSometimes, industry structure shifts because firms that supply other firms or major customers die or because firms merge or acquire each other.

This paper extends that work by exploring the other key punctuating event in the evolution of a technology: the emergence of a dominant design after a technological discontinuity. \nWe argue that a breakthrough innovation inaugurates an era of ferment in which competition among variations of the original breakthrough culminates in the selection of a single dominant configuration of the new technology. Successful variations are preserved by the incremental evolution of this standard architecture until a new discontinuous advance initiates a new cycle of variation, selection, and retention. \nThe key punctuation points are technological discontinuities and dominant designs; these delimit eras of ferment and eras of incremental change. \nAt rare and irregular intervals in every industry, innovations appear that \"command a decisive cost or quality advantage and that strike not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms, but at their foundations and their very lives\" (Schumpeter, 1942: 84). Such innovations depart dramatically from the norm of continuous incremental innovation that characterizes product classes, and they may be termed technological discontinuities.

They represent, in my description of it, what happens to a business when a major change takes place in its competitive environment. \nA major change due to introduction of new technologies. \nA major change due to the introduction of a different regulatory environment. \nThe major change can be simply a change in the customers' values, a change in what customers prefer. Almost always it hits the corporation in such a way that those of us in senior management are among the last ones to notice.\nThe biggest difficulty with Strategic Inflection Points is telling one from the many changes that impinge on you in the business. \nHow do you know if a change is just a garden variety change or qualified to be this monumental, catastrophic change category that we call an Inflection Point\n \nI could never come up with a particularly satisfactory answer to that question.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n50\n\nIndicators of a Strategic Inflection Point\nHas your most dangerous competitor changed\n\nDo the people you have worked with for years suddenly make no sense\n\nAre there customers out there rejecting your offering for something else entirely\n\nAre customers paying attention to new technologies that you are ignoring\n\nIs there a growing divergence between what important competitors are saying and doing",

These are empirical observations. \nOne of the empirical observations with companies that are dealing with Strategic Inflection Points, or are in the middle of them, is that there is a growing divergence, a dissonance if you will, between the strategy statements of those companies and the strategy actions. \nWhich of those two adapts to the new realities first\n It is strategic actions. Because strategic actions are driven by the competition, driven by the sales force, driven by the sheer necessity of winning business in the marketplace day in and day out. \nIt is a long way before the collection of those strategy actions ends up into the reformulation of what the corporation says it is about.\nWe have a phrase inside Intel. We are supposed to be a data driven company and the phrase is, \"Don't argue with the emotions, argue with the data.\" \nAnd I'm going to say you have to argue with the data at times like this because the data that deal with your business are pertinent to your past, and don't say anything about your future.

People must try different techniques, review different products, exploit different sales channels and go after different customers. Much as management may like to make and keep order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old runs will bring new insights.\nThe dilemma is that we can not suddenly start experimenting when we realize we are in trouble unless we have been experimenting all along. It’s too late to do it once things have changed in our core business.\nTaking an organization through a strategic inflection point is a march through unknown territory. The rules of business are still not clear. People lack a mental map of the new environment, and even the shape of the desired goal is not completely clear.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n55",

We have the ability to make innovation a reliable engine for growth, an engine based on a clear understanding of causality, rather than simply casting seeds in the hopes of one day harvesting some fruit. \nConfidential for classroom use only\n88\n\nWhat is a Job",

They perform jobs that formerly had only inadequate or nonexistent solutions. \nJobs are never simply about the functional — they have important social and emotional dimensions, which can be even more powerful than functional ones. \nBecause jobs occur in the flow of daily life, the circumstance is central to their definition and becomes the essential unit of innovation work — not customer characteristics, product attributes, new technology, or trends. \nJobs to Be Done are ongoing and recurring.

    "content": "We Don’t Create Jobs, We Discover Them\nIt’s important to note that we don’t “create” jobs, we discover them. Jobs themselves are enduring and persistent, but the way we solve them can change dramatically over time. Think, for example, of the job of sharing information across long distances. That underlying job has not changed, but our solutions for it have: from Pony Express to telegraph to air mail to email and so on. \nOur understanding of the Job to Be Done can always get better. Adopting new technologies can improve the way we solve Jobs to Be Done. But what’s important is that you focus on understanding the underlying job, not falling in love with your solution for it. \nFor innovators, understanding the job is to understand what consumers care most about in that moment of trying to make progress. Jobs Theory enables innovators to make the myriad, detailed tradeoffs in terms of which benefits are essential and which are extraneous to a new offering.\n\nNOTE: Jobs Theory is not useful if there is no real struggle for a consumer or the existing solutions are good enough. It’s not useful when the decision to be made relies almost entirely on a mathematical analysis, such as commodities trading. Cost or efficiency is not a core element of a job. In those circumstances, there is not a complex bundle of social, emotional, and functional needs in search of progress. There are rational decisions to be made— and ones that can just as easily be made by a computer.",

Jobs insights are fragile — they’re more like stories than statistics. When we deconstruct coherent customer episodes into binary bits, such as “male/ female,” “large company/ small company,” “new customer/ existing customer,” we destroy meaning in the process. \nJobs Theory doesn’t care whether a customer is between the ages of forty and forty-five and what flavor choice they made that day. Jobs Theory is not primarily focused on “who” did something, or “what” they did— but on “why.” \nUnderstanding jobs is about clustering insights into a coherent picture, rather than segmenting down to finer and finer slices. \n… it’s important to emphasize that a well-defined job is multilayered and complex. And that is actually a good thing. Why\n Because it means that perfectly satisfying someone’s job likely requires not just creating a product, but engineering and delivering a whole set of experiences that address the many dimensions of the job and then integrating those experiences into the company’s processes.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n91",

While it’s helpful to develop a “job hunting” strategy, what matters most is not the specific techniques you use, but the questions you ask in applying them and how you piece the resulting information together. \nA valuable source of jobs insights is your own life. Our lives are very articulate and our own experiences offer fertile ground for uncovering Jobs to Be Done. Some of the most successful innovations in history have derived from the experiences and introspection of individuals. \nWhile most companies spend the bulk of their market research efforts trying to better understand their current customers, important insights about jobs can often be gathered by studying people who are not buying your products — or anyone else’s — a group we call non-consumers. \nIf you observe people employing a workaround or “compensating behavior” to get a job done, pay close attention. It’s usually a clue that you have stumbled on to a high-potential innovation opportunity, because the job is so important and they are so frustrated that they are literally inventing their own solution. \nClosely studying how customers use your products often yields important insights into the jobs, especially if they are using them in unusual and unexpected ways. \nMost companies focus disproportionately on the functional dimensions of their customers’ jobs; but you should pay equally close attention to uncovering the emotional and social dimensions, as addressing all three dimensions is critical to your solution nailing the job.",

The most commonly tracked is what we call the “Big Hire” — the moment you buy the product. But there’s an equally important moment that doesn’t show up in most sales data: when you actually “consume” it. \nThe moment a consumer brings a purchase into his or her home or business, that product is still waiting to be hired again — we call this the “Little Hire.” If a product really solves the job, there will be many moments of consumption.

    "content": "The Storyboard\nDeeply understanding a customer’s real Job to Be Done can be challenging in practice. Customers are often unable to articulate what they want; even when they do describe what they want, their actions often tell a completely different story. \nSeemingly objective data about customer behavior is often misleading, as it focuses exclusively on the Big Hire (when the customer actually buys a product) and neglects the Little Hire (when the customer actually uses it). The Big Hire might suggest that a product has solved a customer’s job, but only a consistent series of Little Hires can confirm it. \nBefore a customer hires any new product, you have to understand what he’ll need to fire in order to hire yours. Companies don’t think about this enough. Something always needs to get fired. \nHearing what a customer can’t say requires careful observation of and interactions with customers, all carried out while maintaining a “beginner’s mind.” This mindset helps you to avoid ingoing assumptions that could prematurely filter out critical information. \nDeveloping a full understanding of the job can be done by assembling a kind of storyboard that describes in rich detail the customer’s circumstances, moments of struggle, imperfect experiences, and corresponding frustrations. \nAs part of your storyboard, it’s critically important to understand the forces that compel change to a new solution, including the “push” of the unsatisfied job itself and the “pull” of the new solution. \nIt is also critical to understand the forces opposing any change, including the inertia caused by current habits and the anxiety about the new. \nIf the forces opposing change are strong, you can often innovate the experiences you provide in a way that mitigates them, for example by creating experiences that minimize the anxiety of moving to something new. \nConfidential for classroom use only\n94",

Starbucks could go national, he told the owners, with “dozens of stores, maybe even hundreds,” and become a brand-name “synonymous with great coffee.” In 1982, he joined the company as marketing chief.\nHere, Starbucks history gets complicated.

They’re known to question the conventional wisdom of their industry, the fundamental practices of their company, even the validity of their own assumptions. \nQuestions challenge authority and disrupt established structures, processes, and systems, forcing people to have to at least think about doing something differently. \nTo encourage or even allow questioning is to cede power— not something that is done lightly in hierarchical companies or in government organizations, or even in classrooms, where a teacher must be willing to give up control to allow for more questioning.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n108\n\nThree Part Model\nJust asking Why without taking any action may be a source of stimulating thought or conversation, but it is not likely to produce change. \nBasic formula: Q (questioning) + A (action) = I (innovation). \nOn the other hand, Q – A = P (philosophy).",

    "content": "Red Oceans and Blue Oceans\n… the business universe consists of two distinct kinds of space, which we think of as red and blue oceans. Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today-the known market space. In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are well understood. \nHere, companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the space gets more and more crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody.\nBlue oceans denote all the industries not  in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than  fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. There are two ways to create blue oceans:\nIn a few cases, companies can give rise to completely new industries, as eBay did with the online auction industry. \nBut in most cases, a blue ocean is created from within a red ocean when a company alters the boundaries of an existing industry.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n122\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n123",

Within each group there are hundreds of different grape varieties and winemaking techniques! \nRed Wine: Still wine made with black grapes. Red wines range from light to bold.\nWhite Wine: A still wine produced from white and occasionally black grapes. Flavors in white wines span from light to rich.\nRosé Wine: Still wine from black grapes produced by removing the skins before they stain the wine deep red. Rosé is also made by blending red and white wine together. Both dry and sweet styles of rosé are common.\nSparkling Wine: A style of winemaking involving a secondary fermentation that makes bubbles! Sparkling wine can be red, white, or rosé and ranges from lean and dry, to rich and sweet.\nDessert Wine: A style of winemaking involving fortifying wine with spirits. Typically, dessert wines taste sweet, but many dry, fortified wines exist, such as dry Sherry.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n127\nSomething like 10,000 varieties of wine grapes\n127\n\nThe Traditional Producers\nConfidential for classroom use only\n128\nChateau Pichon-Longueville in Pauillac, Bordeaux  (France)\nSource: Google images",

We buy meanings. \nThe more meaningful something is, the more we are attracted to it. Innovation has typically been seen as a matter of “problem solving”. Firms compete to provide better solutions to problems. From this perspective meanings are considered something to understand, not something to innovate. But meanings cannot merely be understood. Meanings can also change and be innovated.\n…innovation driven by design is and how it stands apart from other approaches of innovation. It shows that design is related to the innovation of the meaning of products and services: an innovation that concerns the purpose, the ‘why’ people use things, rather than the functionality and performance of products (i.e. the ‘what’ and ‘how’).\nExample:  “Consumption-driven wealth and status are being replaced by identity, belonging, and a strong desire to contribute and do something “meaningful” rather than just acquire things.”\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n166\nA way of looking at the world with new eyes.

People use things for profound emotional, psychological, and sociocultural reasons as well as utilitarian ones. \nAnalysts have shown that every product and service in consumer as well as industrial markets has a meaning. Firms should therefore look beyond features, functions, and performance and understand the real meanings users give to things. The common assumption, however, is that meanings are not a subject for innovation: they are a given. One must understand them but cannot innovate them. \nInnovation has therefore focused on two strategies: quantum leaps in product performance enabled by breakthrough technologies, and improved product solutions enabled by better analysis of users’ needs.

The problem of poverty in Texas is grossly similar but discretely different from poverty in Nairobi, so no practical characteristics describe “poverty.” \nIt’s hard, maybe impossible, to measure or claim success with wicked problems because they bleed into one another, unlike the boundaries of traditional design problems that can be articulated or defined. \nSolutions to wicked problems can be only good or bad, not true or false. There is no idealized end state to arrive at, and so approaches to wicked problems should be tractable ways to improve a situation rather than solve it. \nThere is no template to follow when tackling a wicked problem, although history may provide a guide. Teams that approach wicked problems must literally make things up as they go along. \nThere is always more than one explanation for a wicked problem, with the appropriateness of the explanation depending greatly on the individual perspective of the designer. \nEvery wicked problem is a symptom of another problem. The interconnected quality of socio-economic political systems illustrates how, for example, a change in education will cause new behavior in nutrition. \nNo mitigation strategy for a wicked problem has a definitive scientific test because humans invented wicked problems and science exists to understand natural phenomena. \nOffering a “solution” to a wicked problem frequently is a “one shot” design effort because a significant intervention changes the design space enough to minimize the ability for trial and error.\nEvery wicked problem is unique. \nDesigners attempting to address a wicked problem must be fully responsible for their actions.",

Because Births is a flow (representing the rate of increase in Population), and Population is a stock, a CLD (causal loop diagram) does not represent this system as accurately as does a stock and flow diagram. In the CLD, both links in this loop are “s” links, indicating that as Births increase, Population increases (a change in the same direction), and as Population increases, Births increase (another change in the same direction).\nHowever, this representation is not completely accurate. If Birth Rate declines, causing Births to decrease, say from 1000 to 900 per month, Population does not in turn decrease; it continues to increase, only at a slower rate than before. Thus the “s” link from Births to Population is accurate only when Births is increasing, because Births and Population do not move in the same direction when Births decrease.\nIn contrast, a stock and flow diagram makes it visually apparent that Births is an inflow to Population and thus can only increase it, not decrease it (because there cannot be a negative number of births). This distinction between stocks and flows makes stock and flow diagrams a more accurate rendition of the system being represented.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n22\nhttps://thesystemsthinker.com/step-by-step-stocks-and-flows-improving-the-rigor-of-your-thinking/\nWhich is better\n\n22",

    "content": "Summary\nR1 (Fish Regenera8on Loop): More adult fish leads to more regeneration rate for a given fractional regeneration rate, which generates more adult fish a9er the maturation time delay. This is the key regeneration loop that causes fish population to grow over time . \nB2 (Limits to Growth Loop): Healthy ecosystem in the diagram denotes carrying capacity. There is a carrying capacity in the marine ecosystem that supports a given amount of fish population. More fish, higher fish density for a given carrying capacity (thus less nutrients per fish), which leads to lower fractional regeneration rate. When total fish population reaches its carrying capacity, reproduction slows down, as there is no more capacity to support further population growth. Starting from a small population relative to this carrying capacity, the fish population over time will grow and eventually stabilizes near this carrying capacity. \nR2 (Race for Fish Loop): less adult fish stock, less catch per unit effort, which lowers fishing income and drives up fishing effort. More fishing effort increases catch and further declines fish stock. This is a key reinforcing loop that causes the fishery to collapse. \nR3 (Fish Price Loop): overfishing (both legal and illegal catch) causes market price to collapse and reduces income, which drives up fishing effort and leads to further overfishing. \nR4 (Erosion of Carrying Capacity Loop): more fishing effort leads to more habitat damage and erodes carrying capacity, which lowers regeneration rate and increases mortality rate that leads to fishery decline. \nR5 (Economic Growth Loop): less fishing income leads to more non‐fishing activities such as aquaculture and agriculture. Without proper regulation, these economic activities increase pollution and cause faster erosion of healthy ecosystem. \nR6 (Healthy Ecosystem Loop): habit conservation and pollution regulation improve ecosystem health, which attract eco‐tourism as alternative income, reduce fishing effort and polluting activities, and further improve ecosystem health. \nR7 (Sustainable Fish Loop): healthy ecosystem improves fish quality. Under Catch Shares program, fishermen have incentives to improve the health of fishery, which could lead to higher price premium for certified fish. Higher price allows fishermen to meet their income target with lower catch, which helps restore the fish stock. \nR8 (Civic Engagement Loop): sense of urgency, program benefits and stakeholder trust building increase civic engagement in program implementation, which further reinforce program benefits, trust building and civic engagement. This is a key implementation loop for scaling up the fishery restoration.",

It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n78\nConfidential for classroom use only\n\nHow Do You Know\n\n﻿How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff: \nCan you identify parts\n . . . and \nDo the parts affect each other\n . . . and \nDo the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own\n . . . and perhaps \nDoes the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstances\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n79\nConfidential for classroom use only",

Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.\n﻿If information-based relationships are hard to see, functions or purposes are even harder. A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system. The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.\n﻿Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.\n﻿An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation.\n﻿Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.\n﻿A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n80\nConfidential for classroom use only",

The feedback mechanism may not be strong enough to bring the stock to the desired level. Feedbacks—the interconnections, the information part of the system—can fail for many reasons. Information can arrive too late or at the wrong place. It can be unclear or incomplete or hard to interpret. The action it triggers may be too weak or delayed or resource-constrained or simply ineffective.\n﻿The second kind of feedback loop is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that can cause healthy growth or runaway destruction. It is called a reinforcing feedback loop, and will be noted with an R in the diagrams. It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there (and less input the less that is already there). A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it.\n﻿Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity to reinforce or reproduce itself.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n84\nConfidential for classroom use only",

However, stocks don’t necessarily have to be physical things. They can also be feelings or attitudes people hold. The amount of anger you hold toward a cheating spouse or an alcoholic parent can also be viewed as a stock. Stocks are not static. They change over time based on the impacts of a flow. Stocks are snapshots in time, showing a current condition of the changing flows in the system. \nFlow:  Flows are the actions that impact a system. A flow might be a success or a failure, purchases or sales, deposits or withdrawals, births or deaths, or growths or declines. To illustrate how flows impact the stocks, I’ve added Picture 3. The rectangle stands for the stock. This stock is affected by two flows, specifically an inflow and an outflow. Stocks can be affected by multiple inflows and outflows, but for the sake of simplicity let’s stick to only one of each. The little clouds represent where the flows come from or go. Flows can be increased or decreased through intervention.\nConfidential for classroom use only",

This is called dynamic equilibrium. \nThe level of a stock is increased if its outflow is decreased or its inflow is increased. \nStocks provide a security barrier in a system, since they serve to delay the initial shock that may affect a system. \nStocks preserve the ability of inflows and outflows to remain independent.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n88\nConfidential for classroom use only\n\nComponents\n﻿Systems dynamics show the nonlinear behavior tendencies of complex systems. \nWith the help of stocks, flows, feedbacks, and delays we can detect how quickly changes happen within the system. Often the behavior of the whole system can’t be explained based only on the behavior of its individual parts. In other words, determining what kinds of interactions are at play between the elements is very important. \nStocks and flows are the building blocks of the systems dynamics model. \nThe components of systems stories are: \nVariables; \nLinks; \nMental Models; \nDirection of Links; \nDelays; \nFeedback Loops\nConfidential for classroom use only\n89\nConfidential for classroom use only",

    "content": "Variables\n﻿Variables are usually neutral nouns. They present elements in situations where behavior patterns change over time. \nDavid Peter Stroh, a systems thinking expert, defines variables as “the nouns of Systems Thinking language. They are the key forces in a systems story that impact each other and change, or literally vary, over time. As such they are critical elements in building a compelling understanding of what has been happening and why. Systems Thinking has the advantage of being able to combine quantitative variables such as profits with qualitative variables such as morale.”\nVariables in systems thinking language have a few strict characteristics. Besides being neutral nouns, they are not events. The value of a variable can go up and down over time. The nouns you use for variables should incorporate the level of change over time.\n﻿Performance measuring variables: When we want to solve a complex problem with the help of systems thinking, we usually face an issue with more than one “symptom of dysfunction.” It’s a good idea to also have more than one performance measure we wish to understand and change.\n﻿Stroh identifies and groups five types of general variables: “\nGoals \nDesired level of __________ \nThinking/feeling/perceptions  \nLevel of commitment to __________ \nLevel of alignment around __________ \nLevel of clarity about __________ \nPerceived level of __________ \nMorale \nDemand  \nPressure to __________ \nNeed for __________ \nDemand to __________ \nGap between __________ and __________ \nCompetitive Pressure \nSupply  \nCapacity for __________ \nAbility to __________ \nAvailable resources (e.g., time/people/experience) for __________ \nInvestment in __________ \nResults  \nActual level of performance (e.g., profitability, revenue, cycle time, cost, turnover, customer satisfaction, market share) \nQuality of __________”\nConfidential for classroom use only\n90\nConfidential for classroom use only",

The mechanism works through what we call a feedback loop. Feedback loops either keep a stock’s level within a certain range or make it increase or decrease. No matter the feedback loop’s strength, the inflows and outflows to and from the stock are determined by the size of the stock itself.\n﻿Again, the stock’s size determines the amount of increase or decrease the feedback loop generates over time. Identifying the variables and the links between them leads to the discovery of a feedback loop (or causal loop – both names are used interchangeably).\n﻿There are two types of feedback loops. …The performance-over-time pattern gives a visible hint about the structure determining the behavior. \nReinforcing processes lead to growth or decay. They are often referred to as vicious or virtuous cycles. \nBalancing processes work to stabilize the stock at a given level. The balancing process can be referred to as a goal-seeking or limiting due to a constraint.\n﻿The loops can be designed to be read either clockwise or counterclockwise. All that matters is consistency and the correct order of the relationship. \nA loop can’t be reinforcing and balancing at the same time. If you can’t decide which case applies, it means the story is not yet finished.

It’s a long and complicated supply chain spanning multiple countries and businesses.\nEvery step comes with a significant environmental effect. According to Levi Strauss & Co., a pair of 501 jeans, the company’s signature cut, used nearly 3,000 liters of water by the time it hit the shop floor and emitted 20 kilograms of CO2e (a measure that encompasses all greenhouse gases) in 2015.\n…if we’re going to make truly planet-friendly jeans, companies will have to immerse themselves in every part of their products’ life cycles, break down those silos and swallow some higher costs.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n29\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/18/blue-jeans-in-line-for-an-environmental-redesign/67cc4e32-6d75-11ee-b01a-f593caa04363_story.html\nisMobile=1\n\nEnvironmental Impact\nConfidential for classroom use only\n30",

It may still be possible for a few firms to keep growing fast by attracting customers from competitors, but this is likely to be increasingly difficult. \nAnother possibility is to expand into new geographic markets, but there are often real limits to this approach. \nLeading a process of industry consolidation by absorbing competitors can also bring continued growth for some time. But there are obvious limits to this source of growth as well. \nThus, if a firm is to continue to grow at substantial rates, it must ultimately be by developing business opportunities beyond its original scope.\nAcquisitions are one way to get into new businesses. Acquisitions readily lead to higher sale numbers and higher total profits, but the implications for value creation and profitability are less clearly positive. \nIn general, it seems very hard for firms to benefit their owners by buying other firms. The difficulties are twofold. First is to avoid having all the potential value creation flow to the shareholders of the acquired firm. The second is to realize the potential gains once the transaction is completed.\n\nJohn Roberts, The Modern Firm (Oxford University Press: 2004).\nBut what drives innovation\n\n5",

Say defined entrepreneurship, as changing the yield of resources. Or, as a modern economist would tend to do, it can be defined in demand terms rather than in supply terms, that is, as changing the value and satisfaction obtained from resources by the consumer.\nSystematic innovation therefore consists in the purposeful and organized search for changes, and in the systematic analysis of the opportunities such changes might offer for economic or social innovation.\nThe overwhelming majority of successful innovations exploit change. \nTo be sure, there are innovations that in themselves constitute a major change; some of the major technical innovations, such as the Wright Brothers’ aeroplane, are examples. But these are exceptions, and fairly uncommon ones. \nMost successful innovations are far more prosaic; they exploit change. \nAnd thus the discipline of innovation (and it is the knowledge base of entrepreneurship) is a diagnostic discipline: a systematic examination of the areas of change that typically offer entrepreneurial opportunities. \nConfidential for classroom use only\n7\nPeter Drucker, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Routledge Classics, 1985).

But then they ask, ‘Which of these opportunities fits me, fits this company, puts to work what we (or I) are good at and have shown capacity for in performance\n’\nAnd finally, innovation is an effect in economy and society, a change in the behaviour of customers, of teachers, of farmers, of eye surgeons – of people in general. Or it is a change in a process – that is, in how people work and produce something.

In this third version, the parameters increased by more than 10 times, now holding a whopping 175 billion parameters.

    "content": "JHU Dept of Bio-Medical Engineering: Grand Challenges\nBridging precision engineering and precision medicine for personalized physiology avatars: In an increasingly digital age, we have technologies that gather immense amounts of data on patients, which clinicians can add to or pull from. Making use of this data to develop accurate models of physiology, called “avatars” – which take into account multimodal measurements and comorbidities, concomitant medications, potential risks and costs – can bridge individual patient data to hyper-personalized care, diagnosis, risk prediction, and treatment. Advanced technologies, such as wearable sensors and digital twins, can provide the basis of a solution to this challenge.\nThe pursuit of on-demand tissue and organ engineering for human health: Tissue engineering is entering a pivotal period in which developing tissues and organs on demand, either as permanent or temporary implants, is becoming a reality. To shepherd the growth of this modality, key advancements in stem cell engineering and manufacturing – along with ancillary technologies such as gene editing – are required. Other forms of stem cell tools, such as organ-on-a-chip technology, can soon be built using a patient’s own cells and can make personalized predictions and serve as “avatars.”\nRevolutionizing neuroscience using artificial intelligence (AI) to engineer advanced brain-interface systems: Using AI, we have the opportunity to analyze the various states of the brain through everyday situations and real-world functioning to noninvasively pinpoint pathological brain function. Creating technology that does this is a monumental task, but one that is increasingly possible. Brain prosthetics, which supplement, replace or augment functions, can relieve the disease burden caused neurological conditions. Additionally, AI modeling of brain anatomy, physiology, and behavior, along with the synthesis of neural organoids, can unravel the complexities of the brain and bring us closer to understanding and treating these diseases.\nEngineering the immune system for health and wellness: With a heightened understanding of the fundamental science governing the immune system, we can strategically make use of the immune system to redesign human cells as therapeutic and medically invaluable technologies. The application of immunotherapy in cancer treatment provides evidence of the integration of engineering principles with innovations in vaccines, genome, epigenome and protein engineering, along with advancements in nanomedicine technology, functional genomics, and synthetic transcriptional control.\nDesigning and engineering genomes for organism repurposing and genomic perturbations: Despite the rapid advances in genomics in the past few decades, there are obstacles remaining in our ability to engineer genomic DNA. Understanding the design principles of the human genome and its activity can help us create solutions to many different diseases that involve engineering new functionality into human cells, effectively leveraging the epigenome and transcriptome, and building new cell-based therapeutics. Beyond that, there are still major hurdles in gene delivery methods for in vivo gene engineering, in which we see biomedical engineering being a component to the solution to this problem.",

Surprises and errors can play havoc with plans and with smooth operations. In their zeal to reduce uncertainty and minimize errors, organizations fall into the predictability trap and the perfection trap.\nInsight is the opposite of predictable. Insights are disruptive. They come without warning, take forms that are unexpected, and open up unimagined opportunities. Insights get in the way of progress reviews because they reshape tasks and even revise goals. They carry risks—unseen complications and pitfalls that can get you in trouble.\nBusiness organizations treat disruptive insights and innovations with suspicion…defining performance by what can be objectively measured and downplaying the rest.\nThese forces—the need for predictability and the need for perfection (avoidance of errors)—aren’t values that organizations choose. They seem to be inherent in the very nature of organizations.\nSome of the activities listed in the table have definite benefits: having standards, having management controls, conducting progress reviews, expecting people to justify their conclusions, using checklists, setting up schedules.

It is about seeing things differently, what we call insight.\n87\n\nPerfection and Predictability\nI am defining “perfection” as the absence of errors. Organizations naturally gravitate toward reducing errors. Errors are easy to define, easy to measure, and easy to manage. The quest for perfection, for mistake-free performance, can be thought of as the War on Error. It is right up there with the quest for predictability. These are both inherent in running an organization that depends on managing people and projects. In well-ordered situations, with clear goals and standards and stable conditions, the pursuit of perfection makes sense. But not when we face complex and chaotic conditions, with standards that keep evolving.\n…\nChecklists and procedures ensure predictability. They work best when all the uncertainties have been resolved and the practitioners converge on a standard way to work safely, efficiently, and effectively. These processes work best in well-ordered situations with clearly understood tasks. Unfortunately, organizations often are tempted to use them in complex situations with ambiguous tasks.\n…\nHowever, insights can take us beyond perfection. They can show us ways to improve on the original plan.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n88",

There are other types of frames besides stories, such as maps and even organizational wiring diagrams that show where people stand in a hierarchy. My work centers on stories because they are common ways we frame the events in the situations we encounter. These kinds of stories organize all kinds of details about a situation and depend on a few core beliefs we can call “anchors,” because they are fairly stable and anchor the way we interpret the other details. In some later research I found that most of these stories build on only three or four anchors.\n...So I had a working definition of insight—an unexpected shift to a better story—along with the ways insights transform us. I also had some ideas about what makes insights unique. Compared with routine problem solving, insights aren’t conscious or deliberate. They come without warning. Our minds do their heavy lifting without our awareness.\nInsights are unique in some other ways. When they do appear, they are coherent and unambiguous. They don’t come as part of a set of possible answers. When we have the insight, we think, “Oh yes, that’s it.” We feel a sense of closure. This sense of closure produces a feeling of confidence in the insight.\n…As a friend summarized all these transformations, “Insight is when it happens, everything that happens afterward is different.”",

None of them are wrong. \nThe Triple Path Model of insight illustrates why people seem to be talking past each other.

They have the same trigger: our thinking is stimulated when we notice the new anchor. Coincidences and curiosities aren’t insights in themselves; they start us on the path to identifying a new anchor that we connect to the other beliefs we hold. Connections, coincidences, and curiosities have the same activity: to combine the new anchor with others. This path to insight doesn’t force us to abandon other anchors. It lets us build a new story that shifts our understanding. This path has a different motivation, a different trigger, and a different activity from the contradiction and the creative desperation paths. Nevertheless, like the other two paths, the outcome is the same: an unexpected shift in the story.\nThis shift isn’t a minor adjustment. It means changing the core components, the anchors, used in the story. With contradictions and creative desperation, some of the previous anchors are discarded. With connections, a new anchor is added. In all the paths the anchors in the story after we make an insight are different from the ones we started with.\nEach of the three paths, the contradiction path, the connection path, and the creative desperation path, gets sparked in a different way. And each operates in a different fashion: to embrace an anomaly that seems like a weak anchor in a frame, to overturn that weak anchor, or to add a new anchor.\nThe bottom of the diagram of the Triple Path Model shows different routes to the outcome. It shows some direct routes from the three strategies, but also some crossovers. That’s because many of the insights in my sample relied on more than one path.\nMultiple paths are the rule, not the exception. The diagram doesn’t show all possible blends, which would get complicated. Most of the blends relied at some point on the connection path, and so I have portrayed the other two paths joining the connection path.",

Sometimes the person sees a new way to combine different kinds of information even if none of them are new.\nThe strategy offers a clear image of insights as connecting the dots. And it suggests that we can increase insights by exposing ourselves to lots of different ideas that might help us form new connections.\n…\nThese examples come across as connecting the dots because I haven’t told you about all the non-dots. The non-dots would have slowed the stories down, but they are an important part of each insight—determining which dots to connect. Anyone can connect the dots if we remove the non-dots and clarify the ambiguous dots and group the dots that look different but are really the same. If all that is left is a set of unique and valid dots, then the job of connecting the dots becomes much easier. If we leave in all the ambiguities, then the connection gets trickier.\nThe connection path thrives on having lots of ideas swirling around and on making accidental linkages. The more swirl and turbulence, the greater the chance for a discovery.\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n93",

    "content": "Contradictions, Coincidences, Curiosity\nThe contradiction path to insights seems to follow a common script: we encounter an anomaly, we resist the temptation to discard it, we give it credence and imagine that it is valid, and then we revise the rest of our beliefs to make it all fit. Usually we have to discard some of our earlier beliefs, even major ones that have anchored our understanding up to now. \nContradiction insights send us on the road to a better story. They signal that there’s something seriously wrong with the story we’re currently telling ourselves.\n\nContradictions are different from curiosity insights. Curiosities make us wonder what’s going on, whereas contradictions make us doubt—“That can’t be right.” Contradictions between theory and evidence, between expectations and observations….\nWe are built to notice associations and coincidences, and we are also built to detect anomalies, inconsistencies, irregularities. We are built to attend to cues that violate our expectancies and arouse our curiosity. We are built to be surprised.\nAre contradictions really insights, or are they what lead to an insight\n They certainly lead to insights, to the better story. I believe they also count as an insight. Noticing a contradiction shifts the way we understand things.",

    "content": "Creative Desperation\nCreative desperation, a fifth insight strategy, is very different from connecting ideas or noticing coincidences or curiosities or contradictions. Creative desperation requires finding a way out of a trap that seems inescapable.\nBoth the contradiction cases and the cases of creative desperation directed people’s attention to outliers—important beliefs that weren’t firmly supported. However, in the desperation cases people did not look for ways to reframe their understanding around the weak, anomalous anchor. Just the reverse. People who are in desperate straits attack the weak anchor instead of embracing it. In times of desperation, we actively search for an assumption we can reverse. We don’t seek to imagine the implications if the assumption was valid. Rather, we try to improve the situation by eliminating the assumption.\nNotice that creative desperation is more conscious and deliberate than spotting connections, coincidences, curiosities, and contradictions. People aren’t accidentally stumbling onto insights. They are actively searching for them. The creative desperation path requires us to critically examine our assumptions to detect any that are tripping us up.",

So I am forced to imagine where the insight came from. I imagine Dodge and the crew running for their lives, dropping their tools, realizing they are trapped. I try to imagine Dodge’s beliefs about what is going on. Four beliefs in particular seem to anchor Dodge’s understanding. One anchor is the uphill slope. It favors the fire, not the runners, and it is getting steeper. A second anchor is the fire behind me. It is picking up speed. Perhaps a third anchor is any island of safety I might find. If I could get to the top of the ridge, the fire would stop racing after me. Or if I could find a rocky patch, the fire might leave me alone because it wouldn’t have any fuel. I see a rocky area way up ahead (the other two survivors reached these rocks and took protection there), but I know I can’t get there in time. It is about 200 yards away, uphill yards, with the fire perhaps thirty seconds behind me. A fourth anchor is the heavy dry grass I am running through, bunchgrass and cheatgrass. It is the fuel that the fire is eating. I don’t spend any time thinking about how to change the slope of the valley walls or beat the fire back. These anchors are part of my situation, but beyond my control. I can’t reach the rocky areas on the ridge before the fire will catch me. But maybe I can do something to this last anchor, to the fuel. How can I neutralize the fuel\n Of course! I can burn it! Fire, my enemy, can also be my friend. I light the escape fire to race up the slope ahead of me, and I dive into the hot ashes, my sanctuary from the blowup. In my imaginary account of Dodge’s thinking, he is looking for any assumption that he can overturn. When he finds one, the grass fuel, he has an escape plan.",

    "content": "Origins\nThe term red team dates back to the early 1800s, when the Prussian army began using Kriegsspiel, or “war gaming,” to train its officers. \nOne group of officers would develop a battle plan, while another group would assume the role of the enemy and try to thwart it. \nThe idea was to expose flaws or weaknesses in Prussian tactics in the safety of the war room rather than wait for them to be revealed on the battlefield. \nThese tabletop simulations used wooden blocks as stand-ins for military units. Because most Prussian soldiers wore blue uniforms, the home team was represented by blue game pieces. The enemy force was represented by red markers and referred to as “the red team.” It was their job to probe for weaknesses in the Prussians’ plans and strategies. \nThe name stuck.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n59\n\nThe Basics\nA red team is a group that pretends to be the enemy.\n\nAs the U.S. Department of Defense explains: \nRed teams are established by an enterprise to challenge aspects of that very enterprise’s plans, programs, assumptions, etc. \nIt is this aspect of deliberate challenge that distinguishes red teaming from other management tools.\n\nAll plans are based on assumptions, all assumptions are based on understanding, and that understanding is frequently limited and often flawed. \nBy challenging your assumptions, red teaming makes your plan stronger.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n60",

It is a process to create a portfolio of possible futures, each representing a different way your business landscape could look in a few years, and not just the landscape, but also the players who inhabit it—your competitors, customers, suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders. \nThe scenarios will naturally differ from each other in some key aspects, probably even dramatically so, but in its essential makeup, each one will be realistic and entirely possible, given your reading of today’s trends. Based on these different scenarios, you and your planning team can then sit down and formulate more flexible strategies that ensure your organization has the agility to compete in whichever future does in fact come to pass—even one that is different again from the scenarios envisaged.\nThe essence of leadership, therefore, is to be constantly gaming the future—grasping its possibilities, communicating a vision of the role you want your organization to play in this new future landscape, and inspiring your team to help you make that vision a reality.\nConfidential for classroom use only\n74\nConfidential for classroom use only",

But alas, a scenario is not a prophecy that any particular future will actually come to pass. If only it were that easy!

Interviewees bring subjective opinion and subtle judgment into the equation, but also imagination and blue-sky thinking—all based on experience. All of these things are valuable. \nWho to interview\n \nWhat to ask\n \nIdentify a number of knowledgeable, opinionated people—preferably stakeholders in your future success, or people with an interest in how your environment will develop.

Identifying Driving Forces\n﻿Now we come to the workshop itself, the crucible in which the participants meet, discuss, argue, and (we hope) finally agree on certain key attributes of the future and craft scenarios based on these choices.\nWhat exactly is a driving force\n In a nutshell, a driving force is something with the potential to bring about significant change in the future. It may be a trend, already clearly defined and understood—for example, the falling fertility rate in Italy, which will have a fairly predictable impact on the number of Italians who will be 20 years old two decades from now. Another kind of driving force is a variable that has the potential to change the future in significant ways but is not very predictable as it is itself dependent on several factors. A good example is the price of oil.\nThe classic tool for helping generate a list of driving forces is the “PEST” model. \nThere are other models out there that include additional categories, such as “Environmental” (which turns PEST into STEEP). Probably the most exhaustive one that I’ve seen breaks driving forces down into a whopping 10 categories: Social, Technological, Economic, Business methods, Natural resources, Political, Demographic, International, Legal, Environmental\n\nConfidential for classroom use only\n79\nConfidential for classroom use only",

Specifically, political factors have areas including tax policy, labour law, environmental law, trade restrictions, tariffs, and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided …and those that the government does not want to be provided…. Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the health, education , and infrastructure of a nation.\nEconomic factors include economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation rate. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm’s cost of capital and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy.\nSocial factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour). Furthermore, companies may change various management strategies to adapt to social trends caused from this (such as recruiting older workers).\nTechnological factors include technological aspects like R&D activity, automation, technology incentives and the rate of technological change. These can determine barriers to entry, minimum efficient production level and influence the outsourcing decisions. Furthermore, technological shifts would affect costs, quality, and lead to innovation.",

Not so with many other trends (e.g., new technologies), which may come screaming out of the blue, taking the market and the world by complete surprise. In addition, for any given organization, some of the uncertainties about the future are more important than others. Their potential impact is greater. \nIf I’m planning a picnic two weeks from Saturday, two uncertainties I will be confronted with are the weather and the pesky, ever-fluctuating price of cheese.

Instead, driving forces E and F are selected, as both are considered high-uncertainty, high-impact, even though E is possibly less important than D. Having selected E and F as the critical uncertainties, the next step is to create a new graph, a classic 2 × 2 matrix with E and F as the axes. The four quadrants of this graph now define the basic contours of four different future scenarios. Each one is defined in terms of an “either/or” outcome for the two critical uncertainties. In other words, the four quadrants—we can already call them scenarios—are defined by whether driving force E will be either “high” or “low,” for example, and whether, at the same time, driving force F will be either “big” or “small.”\n\nIn the example that follows, the group would eliminate driving forces/clusters A, B, and C, as these unambiguously represent uncertainties that are less interesting as far as your future is concerned. They are the equivalent of the not-so-important price of cheese for the picnic planned (A or B) and demographic trends that may have a big impact on your organization in the long term but are relatively certain to take place (C).\nConfidential for classroom use only\n84",

What I am really concerned with here is the process – how to bring innovation under analytical control, and get beyond just brainstorming in the local café \n5. Summary\n   1. To summarize, this is a class about innovation; and how to turn innovation into a structured process\n   2. Innovation is about finding problems worth solving, problems that are important to you, and then turning them into opportunities\n   3. Opportunities which can then be turned into new products and services that can actually be built and delivered to the market\n   4. The key paths to finding problems worth solving are \n      1. One, to think differently about the future and the problems that might be found there;\n      2. Two, to exploit change;\n      3. Three, to challenge existing assumptions and paradigms;\n      4. And four, to explore market and technological uncertainty.\n   5. Important, we are not talking about solutions here, i.e. the new products and services that could be delivered to the market, only about the problems worth working on\n   6. Solutions we will deal with next term\n   7. This remainder of the slide deck contains an introduction to the methodology that we have developed at Johns Hopkins and that we will use here in class\n   8. There is no textbook; these slides will function as your textbook and they have been so structured as to act as a resource for you\n   9. In other words, they are not typical corporate slides\n   10.

CHANGE SLIDE\n   4. Both China and the US have massive online markets and they are only getting larger\n   5. Did Covid increase the share of e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales\n - yes, and it is not likely to decrease, as anyone who has seen all the empty malls in America knows\n7. Method 1: Trend Analysis\n   1. One of the most important ways of finding problems worth solving is to learn how to think differently about the future.  Here are two techniques.  We will introduce them briefly today.\n   2. One technique is trend analysis. i.e. carrying a trend to its absurd conclusion and then seeing what you find\n   3. So you could have asked, what if there is no retail at all\n  What will cities look like and what kinds of problems will we find that we can start working on today\n\n1. What will be missing\n\n2.

The second technique for re-imagining the future is what is called scenario analysis\n   2. This is where we create four alternative futures – think of them as stories or science fiction\n   3. The key is to figure out what the axes are\n      1. There is no formula or rule here – whatever seems to work\n   4. And once you have your boxes, they can then be analyzed for what products and services will be needed in that future\n9. Scenario Analysis: E-Commerce\n   1.

Back to our subject, why do you want to be an innovator – because you hate your boss, or you want to be the boss; and because you can’t stand doing the same thing over and over \n   2. Because nobody will pay you what you want to earn just to keep doing what was done well enough yesterday\n   3. But why do companies and organizations need to innovate\n2. Markets Mature\n   1.

Over 15 years ago, I was part of the team that created the Center for Bio-Innovation and Design, CBID, at Hopkins\n      1. It was part of the Bio-Medical Engineering Department (BME), which was itself a joint venture between Engineering and Medicine, and was a rather unique program at its inception\n   3. The idea was to create a graduate level version of the famous undergraduate BME design teams \n   4. Undergraduate design teams worked on projects as presented by Hopkins medical faculty, and all the innovation work was in developing a solution\n   5. By contrast, the idea was that graduate teams would find their own original, innovative projects, which meant starting with finding the right problem\n   6. Students arrived at the beginning of June and then spent the summer observing physicians and surgeons in order to find the next big thing to work on\n8. Example: Getting Out of the Building\n   1. We used a variety of formats, some extensive and some intensive, but they all came down to the same basic idea – get out of the building, go hang out in the Hopkins Hospital, and go see what real people were really struggling with\n   2. In addition to these kinds of structured observations, students heard from experts and lead users\n   3. The goal was, over the summer, build a bank of ideas, hundreds of ideas, and then pick from the best ones to form teams that would actually build out the solution and develop the business case\n   4. On the slide is an example of what you can do when you talk to people\n9. The Challenge of Presentism\n   1. But this is not the only source of problems worth working on, and this is what has been missed in the literature to date\n   2.

A Structured Process for “Doing Innovation”\n1. As a quick overview, the methodology that we have created involves two intersecting models.  \n2. The first is a structured process, including a wide range of tools, techniques, and templates to identify problems that are worth solving across increasing horizons of uncertainty (and lengthening time-scales).  \n3. The result of this process is the creation of a bank of ideas, possibly hundreds of opportunities that can then be evaluated, again in a structured manner, for the best ones.\n15.

    "content": "1. In English, the word problem is problematic because it can refer to a whole range of problems and we call all of them problems\n2. And it is this confusion that our first model attempts to straighten out\n3. Let me give you an example\n4. A class was asked by NATO to design the small combat team of the future\n5. An amazing problem to address; students loved it; they had all grown up playing video games\n      1. And yet they came up with nothing\n      2. Why\n – because there is no way to think about the small combat team of the future without first thinking about the future of war\n16. A Taxonomy of Problems\n1. Our approach is based on the idea that there are three different kinds of problems across three different time horizons\n1. What is possible, and what is plausible, what is probable \n2. What we have called un-defined, ill-defined, and well-defined\n2. Each kind of problem asks different kinds of questions, requires different kinds of tools, different kinds of “solutions,” and different kinds of business cases.\n17. Examples: Different Kinds of Questions\n   1. Here are some examples, all from the world of prosthetics\n   2. Well-defined problems are problems as we normally think of them\n      1. What the solution needs to accomplish is clear, even if it is hard to do\n   3. Ill-defined problems, by contrast, ask what is the next big thing for us here, in this specific technological or market space\n      1. The “solution” is a list of opportunities because lots of things could serve as the next big thing\n      2. The goal is to create that list and then figure out what exactly to work on\n   4. And lastly, un-defined problems ask questions about what the future will look like\n      1. This is not a problem in the normal sense of the word\n      2. Rather it is a description of future states which can be explored for problems worth working on; \n      3. Problems that help us create a list of opportunities that that can be used to prepare for, or even create, a future we want\n   5. To summarize, only well-defined problems can be solved in the traditional sense of the word because only there can the solution be falsified – it works or it doesn’t\n      1. By contrast, ill- and un-defined problems are used to create portfolios of opportunities – the distinction is critical\n      2. The problem here is that all too often we treat all problems as well-defined and use the wrong tools.\n      3. And an even bigger problem is that that the “next big thing” almost always comes from un-defined and ill-defined problems, while the funding always comes from well-defined problems\n18. Problem Types\n   1. The point is that these three kinds of problems exist on a continuum (hence the dotted lines); and you can start anywhere\n      1. But it is not just the nature of the problems, but the relationships among them that matter as well\n   2. The reality is that you can start anywhere and move back and forth across the continuum\n      1. Just as imagining alternative futures allows us to find problems worth working on, so the solutions to important problems allow us to rethink the future\n   3. The big problem here is that we usually treat all problems as if they were well-defined, and apply the wrong tools\n      1. Un-defined and ill-defined problems cannot be solved in any traditional sense of the term\n      2. Rather, they are spaces to explore in order to build a portfolio of opportunities\n19. The Goal: Finding Lots of Opportunities\n1. This famous quote from Linus Pauling will be our guide here\n2. As many good ideas as we can, across as wide a spectrum as we can, in the hope that a few of them turn out to be really good\n1. Your best idea is rarely your first idea, and it rarely grows on a tree\n2. Finding good ideas is hard work, and takes practice\n   1. Generating lots of ideas forces us to think broadly across domains\n      1. You need to get out of your narrow areas of specialization\n   2. It is a chance for you all to improve the flexibility and agility of your thinking in a complex and uncertain world\n20. Opportunities Are…\n   1. So what is an opportunity",

The obvious question now is what makes for a good opportunity\n   2. The usual answers are impact, feasibility, and personal preference\n   3.

    "content": "1. READ FROM SLIDE\n      2. Uncertainty is not risk\n      3. Risk is the probability of loss, injury, or other adverse outcome. It can be estimated and calculated based on our knowledge of prior outcomes and conditions. It has been mathematically formulated since the late 17th century, notably in the work of Blaise Pascal. Most importantly, it can be managed. Risk can be distributed (syndicated), insured against, hedged, and reduced. In short, it can be quantified and controlled.\n      4. Uncertainty is different. It is not subject to exact quantification. It was only recently formalized in the early 20th century work of the economist Frank Knight. It represents all of the possible future states of the world at any given time. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the number of possible outcomes, both positive and negative. It is a source of discomfort because we cannot predict it, but it is also a source of potential value. Higher uncertainty means greater potential, and most of us underestimate the extent of that potential since there are more possible future states of the world than we can possibly comprehend.\n      5. While some view the two as essentially the same and use the words interchangeably, uncertainty is quite distinct from risk, both in its character and in its use. In fact, what sets highly successful entrepreneurs and innovators apart from the rest of the population is the ability to see and use this difference as the basis for their success. The good news is that we can learn from them.\n      6. Btw, this distinction is also why most companies want to size existing markets -- if you have heard the expression \"TAM\" or \"SAM\" (total addressable market, or serviceable addressable market), these are measures of existing, known, markets, since one can numerically estimate the current size of these. My corporate clients often ask me to help them estimate these sizes.    \n      7. Entrepreneurs on the other hand discover entirely new markets -- there is no \"addressable market\" until they do what Drucker famously said in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which is, to \"create a customer.\"  Once we know there are customers for, say, hula hoops or carbonated drinks or spreadsheets, only then can we create an estimate of a TAM.\n      8. We manage risk, but exploit uncertainty\n      9. Entrepreneurs and innovators see value in uncertainty since they earn profits when gains are appreciably greater than is generally expected.\n   3. Who plays in each quadrant\n  What kind of problem is being addressed in each quadrant\n – use space as an example for each quadrant\n      1. Top right: governments; defense departments; where the bets are very big and nothing is clear; e.g. hypersonics, quantum computing; and once nuclear energy and space exploration (over the past two decades, over 10,000 space companies have entered what is being called “new space” (article: The new space race could turn science fiction into reality by RANA FOROOHAR)\n      2. Bottom right: big companies; local governments; where the bets are big in markets and technologies that are well-understood; e.g. battery factories; space: SpaceX, Blue Origin, ViaSat\n      3. Bottom left: company R&D departments; small inventors; the usual incremental, sustaining improvements that are necessary to maintain current products and markets – the problem here is that corporations spend way too much time researching and predicting the present\n         1. We want to build X, and we want to differentiate it from the offerings of competitors\n         2. But how do we do that if both they and us are all operating under the same assumptions\n – are our assumptions about the future valid",

If it were obvious, everybody would see it and there would be no opportunity for innovation or above average gains\n         2. In other words, all innovation exploits uncertainty to a greater or lesser extent\n         3. Space – space debris, space medicine, space agriculture, 3D printing on the moon\n      5. We are proposing the generation and curation of a portfolio of ideas, which may exist all over the four quadrants of the Uncertainty - Risk matrix.  This is a good way for corporations and governments to think about the innovation activities they are engaged in (and perhaps to expand their portfolios -- just as sophisticated investors like to own a wide-ranging investment portfolio, including \"long shots\"). \n   4. Innovation is always a matter of technological and/or market insights – seeing what others do not see\n      1.

First, a structured approach that uses a range of tools, techniques, and templates to explore un-defined and ill-defined spaces\n      1. All with the goal of creating a portfolio of opportunities, of cool ideas, \n   4. Which takes us to the second model, where the best of the opportunities, those that exploit uncertainty while minimizing risk, can then be turned into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n27. Our Work Together\n   1. This is designed to be a two-semester course\n   2. In the first term, we learn how to innovate and as a class we search for problems that are worth solving\n      1. As a class, we will build a portfolio of opportunities\n   3. We then form teams around the best ideas\n   4. And then in the spring, we build or design the solution, and develop the business case\n   5.

In a book you can see cited below, Root-Bernstein points out is that innovation is a way of thinking that uses tools such as you see here\n   2. Work your way down the list\n   3. It begins with being able to observe, to see things with new eyes, to see what others do not\n   4. Moves to pattern recognition and analogizing\n   5.

Here is a another famous list put together by Robert Weisberg – the phrase “I’m thinking” can really refer to any of the activities on this list\n   2. Creative thinking, therefore, is simply a kind of ordinary thinking and can be constructed from the elements on this list\n35. Learning to Orchestrate Cognitive Components\n   1. In other words, creativity is simply organizing these elements into some sort of order, some sort of structure that allows you to solve the problem at hand\n   2. Or for us, find the problem that is important\n36. Gaining a Broad Perspective\n   1. Critical to the ability to put together these elements, particularly in high-uncertainty domains, is having, or gaining, a broad perspective, not narrow expertise\n   2.

    "content": "METHOD 2: SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n1. How to Use Scenario Analysis\n   1. Scenario analysis is a second technique we use to think differently about the future\n      1. Again, this is the entire point of un-defined problems\n   2. The key idea here (and really of both techniques) is that we are not predicting what the future will be, but describing alternative possible futures that are rooted in what is actually happening now\n   3. Trend analysis is straightforward – take a trend, carry it forward, and see if anything interesting shows up\n   4. Scenario analysis is different – it is more formal\n      1. It posits a set of possible futures, but attaches no probabilities\n      2. It creates stories along known dimensions \n   5. READ THE SLIDE – this is the way we create scenarios\n2. Not the Nine Box Matrix\n   1. Scenario analysis is not some version of the 9-box matrix, a popular HR tool used to measure employee performance and to identify employees with leadership potential, created by McKinsey in 1970\n      1. It was later adapted by GE to identify key investments and to compare various business units\n      2. The problem is that probability and impact can really only be measured for low uncertainty opportunities\n   2. By contrast, scenario analysis is not a predictive tool, but a descriptive tool by which we create alternative futures that can then be explored for problems and opportunities\n3. Example: The Future of Education\n   1. Let’s take an example\n   2. What is the future of education\n   3. How would you even begin answering that\n      1. One way is a trend analysis – what will the world look like if we never return to traditional classrooms\n      2. Or, what will the world look like if we are all taught by robots\n   4. With scenario analysis, we build four possible, but distinct futures, and then ask what we might find, or not find, there\n   5. The key starting step is choice of axes – you can see several possibilities on the slide\n      1. A good place to get axes is from a trend analysis\n      2. The point is that there is no perfect way to do scenarios – the only good answer is one that you find useful\n   6. Very important – the scenarios need to mirror each other\n4. Scenario Analysis for Education\n   1. These are the two axes that we chose – delivery method (virtual or in-person) and method of instruction (a real teacher or a robot with AI)\n   2. You will notice that scenarios are given descriptive names, usually accompanied by pictures\n5. Descriptions of the Scenarios\n   1. The next step is to actually write the descriptions\n   2. In general, this would require real research and an analysis of current trends\n   3. Extremely important – the scenarios need to mirror each other, i.e. the same kind of stuff needs to be in each box\n6. Opportunities from Scenario Analysis\n   1. The last step is to then search each scenario for the interesting problems that might be found in such a future – take a look at the ones on the slide\n   2. Problems are, of course, opportunities; and the key is to find the most interesting opportunities that could actually be started today\n   3. A simple way of thinking about this is to ask what kinds of products and services and policies will be needed if this future comes to pass",

So what is a system\n – an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. \n      1. Systems are not random collections of elements.\n   3. A system must consist of three kinds of things: \n      1. elements, \n      2. interconnections, and \n      3. a function or purpose.\n   4. Elements, interconnections, and functions can be placed into what we call a nested hierarchy\n3. Example: Nested Hierarchies\n   1. Systems have a structure, going from the most basic elements all the way up to big, inclusive stuff, what we can call nested hierarchies\n   2. Here is a random example I found online, talking about how to reduce smoking in a population\n      1. Interventions to reduce smoking go can be at the level of the individual, or the community that the individual is part of, all the way to entire populations\n   3. Similarly, we could start thinking about the future of submarines by situating them within a nested hierarchy\n      1. All the way from the hundred or so elements and sub-systems of a submarine to national policy and strategy\n4. Another Example\n   1. Here is another example of systems structure and nested hierarchies\n   2. These levels, their interconnections, and the purpose of the entire system give us a way of exploring not just elements, but their interconnections, and even alternative futures for the system as a whole\n   3. They also give us a way of connecting un-defined with ill-defined problems\n      1.

    "content": "ILL-DEFINED PROBLEMS\n1. Problem Types\n   1. Innovation begins with finding problems worth solving\n   2. Our point is that there are different kinds of problems with different time horizons, different degrees of uncertainty and risk, and they cannot be addressed or “solved” in all the same way\n      1. Un-defined problems are addressed by exploring possible futures and seeing what kinds of problems might be found there that can be addressed starting today\n   3. Ill-defined problems are still traditional in the sense that they are present forward; by contrast, un-defined problems are future backward\n2. Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. Ill-defined problems look at what is plausible in a technology or market space or customer experience in order to find the next big problem worth working on\n      1. The point is that many, many things could answer the question, “What’s the next big thing\n”\n   2. And like un-defined problems, ill-defined problems help us create a portfolio of innovation\n3. Example: What’s Next Big Thing for Electric Vehicles\n   1. Ill-defined problems are not about imagining distant futures, but operate on a shorter time horizon and ask “What’s the next big thing here, in this specific space\n”\n   2. For example, the question on this slide is not “What’s the future of electric vehicles\n” but what’s the next big thing for anyone who will use or manufacture them\n4. Example: Baltimore Harbor\n1. Here is an example\n2. It all began when students went down to the Baltimore Harbor and were shocked by the amount of pollution they saw there; and decided they wanted to do something \n3. Let’s be clear – they did not ask about future state of the harbor\n   1. Rather, the question they asked themselves was how to clean up pollution in waterways\n   2. The possibilities are near endless\n5. Framing an Ill-Defined Problem\n1. Which is what makes it an ill-defined problem – there is no single solution for the simple reason that there is no clearly defined problem yet that can be solved\n1. Something is missing; something is needed to constrain the problem\n2. Supplying those constraints is what then allows us to begin building the lists that are the “answer” to an ill-defined problem\n2. It is the ability to drive the creation of such lists that represents the true power of ill-defined problems (as well as un-defined problems)\n1. And from that list you pick the ones you want to work on\n6. The Process for Creating an Ill-Defined Problem\n   1. So the first thing the students did to address this ill-defined space was to supply the missing elements by clarifying what kind of waterway, and what kind of pollution\n   2. They decided to focus on trash in inland waterways\n   3. And then they made lists of opportunities using a set of tools and techniques\n   4. And the lists were quite extensive – similar to the DTA example on the first day\n7. The Solution\n   1. Then they picked one opportunity and turned it into a well-defined problem\n   2. In this case – how to continuously clean up trash from inland waterways with minimal human intervention and oversight\n – what you see here\n   3. They designed and built a robot that uses AI and computer vision to clean up the harbor – something like a water-based Roomba\n      1. This is a well-defined problem because whatever solution they built either worked or it did not – the solution was falsifiable\n8. The PixieDrone\n1. And, of course, they were years ahead of their time – there are now lots of companies out there chasing the students’ idea, for example the one you see here\n2. Over the years, our students have probably left hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funding on the table from all the good ideas they have chosen not to pursue\n9. Summary: Using Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. To summarize, ill-defined problems are very different from un-defined problems\n      1. They do not ask about future states in a very uncertain world, but simply what is plausibly the next big thing inherent in this particular situation\n      2. And the key is that there is no single answer; in fact, many things could actually address the “problem”\n      3. Hence, we make lists\n   2. Like un-defined problems, ill-defined problems can help us create a bank of interesting opportunities\n      1. From which we can then select the best ones and turn them into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n10. Tools for Exploring Ill-Defined Problems\n   1. So how do we actually explore ill-defined problems – through a combination of intensive and extensive searching of market and technological spaces\n   2. I will give you some tools for going about all this",

A good way of thinking about extensive searching comes from a book by Frans Johansson, where he describes “intersectional ideas,” a theory that he developed by asking why the Renaissance was such an extraordinarily creative period\n12. Intersectional Ideas\n   1. Johansson claims that there are two kinds of ideas:\n   2. Directional ideas are where we know where we are going, and\n   3. Intersectional ideas, where we don’t know where we are going, and are often the product of serendipity\n13. Characteristics\n   1. Intersectional ideas are where we put two things together in surprising, unusual, non-obvious, and fascinating ways.\n   2. The key is that the combination is unexpected\n      1. But this is the way the world has always progressed, and the way technology has always advanced\n      2. Everything “new” is really just a new combination of existing ideas; because no “new thing” comes out of nothing\n   3. Examples:\n      1. Computational biology\n      2. Behavioral economics\n      3. Evolutionary theories of technological development\n      4. Fusion cooking\n      5. The smart phone\n14. Example: Celcy\n   1. Or this example from a student project that is now a real company – they combined a freezer and an oven\n15. How to Make Barriers Fall\n   1. The question is how to create intersectional ideas\n   2. Here are some examples\n   3. This is what companies try to do all the time by forcing people from different parts of the organization to meet and talk, and then wait to see what comes out of it\n16. The Process\n   1. Now you try it – put two things together that have never before been put together\n   2.

    "content": "24. The Technology Complex\n   1. Let’s look at one category of changes in more detail – technology and science\n   2. First it must be remembered that technology is not a simple thing, but represents a complex\n   3. Think of all that is involved in using an induction stove, or a solar panel, or an electric vehicle, or tele-medicine\n25. Technological Transitions\n   1. As these complexes change over time, they undermine the competitive advantages of existing firms\n26. Diminishing Returns\n   1. But as technologies mature, they experience ever diminishing returns\n27. Technology S-Curves\n   1. Technological changes and transitions can be thought of as s-curves, where improvement in the technology per unit of input diminishes over time\n   2. In other words, technological improvement runs up against barriers, either physical or market, and that is when opportunities for disruptive innovations present themselves\n   3. So here is the question, where are technologies reaching their limit\n \n      1. For example, how much more power can they build into your phone before you stop caring, and stop wanting to pay for it\n28. The Innovation Window\n   1. Here is a nice diagram I found that ties s-curves to the product life cycle\n   2. As each stage reaches some sort of maturity, the need for product innovation becomes ever more evident\n   3. Take computers for an example – mainframes to minis to desktops to laptops to whatever – as technologies and markets change\n29. Example\n   1. And another example for you\n30. An Evolutionary Process\n   1. In other words, technological change can be thought of as an evolutionary process where a long series of small changes is abruptly ended by a big change\n31. Technological Discontinuities and Dominant Design\n   1. Big changes lead to what are called technological discontinuities, which create enormous opportunities for innovators\n32. Macro and Micro-Inventions\n   1. Another way to think about this is in terms of micro-and macro-inventions\n   2. Micro-inventions can be explained by basic economics and marketing\n      1. Who wins at micro-changes – incumbent players\n      2. Who often wins at macro-changes – disruptive companies\n   3. The real question is where macro-inventions come from – you can improve a wagon all you want, but you will never get a car.  \n      1. Macro changes are often intersectional ideas (a new combination of things)\n      2. For example, cars come from combining wagons and internal combustion engines.\n33. Dominant Designs\n1. Macro- and micro-changes can be combined in the model you see here\n   1. Technological change can be thought of as an evolutionary process where a long series of small changes is abruptly ended by a big change\n2. Big changes lead to what are called technological discontinuities, which ultimately create what are called dominant designs\n3. So what is a dominant design",

Dominant designs can be thought of as paradigms, whether technological or social or political\n   1. But at some point, they begin to fall apart; you can feel it in the air; and that is when enormous opportunities present themselves\n34. Class Exercise\n   1. Where is a dominant design falling apart\n Whether political, economic, social, or technological\n\n2. What are the changes\n  What is being wrecked\n\n3. Where are the opportunities that come from these changes\n\n35. Strategic Inflection Points\n   1. The next set of slides summarize a famous book by Andy Grove\n   2. Industries have stable structures, until they don’t; similar to dominant designs\n   3. Strategic inflection points are when those structures fall apart\n   4. Look at these diagrams – this is an example of a macro-technological shift at work\n   5. At what point did it all change\n\n1. Why did it all change\n\n2. What made it all change\n\n3. What got wrecked, and then created opportunities\n\n36. Indicators of a Strategic Inflection Point\n   1. The question that Andy Grove explored is how you know when it is happening to you and your company\n   2. His famous point is that you will never see it in the data or the accounting reports",

All this is very interesting, but what concerns us here in this course is trying to figure out the implications of the macro-changes occurring out there\n   2. Once again, we can engage in random brainstorming, or we can try to use a more structured process\n   3. One famous tool is called a futures wheel, invented by Jerome Glenn in 1971 as “a method for graphical visualization of direct and indirect future consequences of a particular change or development”\n   4. Following are a couple of examples – you can see how complicated this can get\n38. What are the Consequences of Widescale Adoption of ….\n\n1. For example, what kind of futures wheel would you construct to think through the implications of changes in the adoption of different technologies\n   2.

    "content": "Understanding Needs – What’s Next for a User Experience\n43. This class we will look for the next great problem to solve by asking what opportunities unsatisfied user experiences offer us, another of Gibson’s four lenses\n44. Example: Warby Parker\n   1. They were JHU grads and completely reimagined how we can buy glasses\n   2. Which industry assumptions did they question; and which technological and social trends did they take advantage of (e.g., the changing nature of how we buy)\n   3. They did not invent either glasses or ordering things online\n      1. All they did was change the user experience, and that changed everything\n45. Example: Casper\n   1. They completely reimagined how we can buy mattresses\n   2. Which industry assumptions did they question; and which technological and social trends did they take advantage of (e.g., the changing nature of how we buy)\n   3. Again, all this seems obvious, but only in retrospect\n46. Example: Improving the User Burrito Experience\n   1. The list of user experiences that can be explored is endless\n      1. Big stuff like how we interact with government or physicians\n      2. Or little stuff, like how we interact with burritos (I could not resist this – they were students of mine)\n   2. But it starts by looking around and seeing the world and our lives with new eyes\n      1. As Warren Berger wrote, as if we were seeing the world for the first time; just like little kids\n47. Process Mapping\n   1. A critical tool here is process mapping (which is what the burrito team did)\n   2. Writing down what users do step by step\n   3. And then ranking how important each step is to you against how satisfied you are\n      1. Where are the opportunities – high importance and low satisfaction \n48. Example: Intralox\n   1. This example comes forma company that we worked with\n   2. The company designs specialized conveyor belts for soft packaging\n   3. The innovation team designed a new product offering and were convinced that they were going to walk away with first prize at the big logistics and material handling conference\n      1. They didn’t even get an honorable mention\n      2. The companies that won are on the top left\n      3. You will notice that they are almost all robotics companies\n   4. So what the team at Intralox did was combine some ideas about dominant designs (the list in the middle) with process mapping in the space that they play in, i.e. bulk parcel management (in yellow) and then see where robots currently play in their space of gravity belts\n   5. What the analysis showed was the space for opportunity for them to move further back in the value chain, rather than just their traditional offerings at the very end\n49. The Advantage of Process Maps\n   1. Process maps allow you visualize what could be eliminated or combined\n   2. And what kinds of new problems could be identified and then addressed\n   3.

Electricity only begins in the 1880s, specifically to light streets, houses, and buildings\n   4. The power plants are small and the distribution is limited\n   5.

And this is a picture of how the system looked in 1930 – completely different\n   2. Something like Andy Groves’ picture of the change in the computer industry between 1980 and 1995\n   3. The system that you see here was the ultimate answer to the key problem facing electricity systems in the 1880s – the problem of costly transmission beyond a few miles\n5. The Idea of a Reverse Salient\n   1. Hughes analyzes this problem in terms of what he calls a reverse salient\n   2. He takes the term from military affairs where a group of soldiers advance beyond their own lines and create a salient or bulge that leaves them exposed to attack from three sides\n   3. A reverse salient is the opposite – one group of soldiers cannot advance, thus holding up the progress of the entire army\n   4. Hughes uses this idea to analyze the progress of electrification, where the progress of the entire system is held up at a specific point, i.e. the high cost of transmission\n   5. He claims that identifying the reverse salient is the key to the creative process, in the sense that it serves as the focus for innovative and inventive activity\n   6. And if this reverse salient is solved, you can be sure that another one will appear\n6. Reverse Salient: The High Cost of Transmission\n   1. Here is his famous diagram of the process of electrification\n7. Correcting Reverse Salients\n   1. Correcting a reverse salient means allowing it to advance (think job to be done) and brings it “back into line” with the rest of the system\n   2. Which then allows the entire system to advance; meaning the progress of electrification across America\n8. One Answer: Change the System\n   1. In the case of electrification, how was this done\n   2. Basically by changing the entire system from DC to AC \n9. Solving the Reverse Salient\n   1. This simple diagram illustrates the change\n   2. AC allowed for the solution of the critical problem, i.e. the high cost of transmission\n10. AC Also had Reverse Salients\n   1. But as always in this world, solving a problem creates a new set of problems\n   2. AC also had its reverse salient – in this case the lack of a practical motor, not to mention the problems cause by higher voltages for insulation and safety\n   3. And not to mention the idea that different kinds of consumers needed different voltages\n11. The Solution\n   1. So the solution we ended up with is what we call a universal system where there is one power generating plant that sends electricity all over the area and all consumers can use it, despite their very different needs\n12. Westinghouse Concept of a Universal Supply System\n   1. This was the solution as devised b Westinghouse\n13. The Solution\n   1. And this is kind of how the system looks now\n14. The Process\n   1. These are the steps for actually using reverse salient – pretty straightforward\n   2. The bigger question is how you go about addressing the reverse salient – here are some of the tools that we believe could help\n15. Examples\n   1. So what domains “out there” are confronting clear reverse salient\n   2. Here is a list prepared by Alexander Rovalino\n16. Case Study – Genomics\n   1. And here is a case study he prepared for you by Alexander\n   2. DNA was discovered in 1871, but it took until 1977 before we sequenced each gene that makes up a single virus for the first time: a full genome. \n      1. The first human genome was completed in 2003 at the cost of 2.7 billion dollars. \n      2. Since then, the technology has improved to the point that it costs less than one thousand dollars and takes less than a day to sequence a genome. \n   3. Today, Illumina dominates the sequencing market, while a number of startups are trying to break their monopoly. \n   4. How did the price of sequencing drop so dramatically\n \n      1. Initial technologies, such as Sanger sequencing, were slow, costly, inaccurate, and generated small amounts of data. \n      2. Like earlier computing technology, advancement was limited by the size of the machine and its serial nature. \n      3. Next-generation-sequencing was introduced to overcome these challenges, using parallel processing and novel chemistry to bring sequencing up to the level of other innovations in computer chips and data storage and analytics. \n      4. It is anticipated that further gradual improvements in sequencing technology will unlock sub-$100 genomes and lead to better disease diagnoses and more personalized medical treatments.\n17. Case Study – Fossil Fuels\n   1. The exploitation of oil and gas has existed for over one thousand years, but the modern oil industry began with wells drilled in the mid-19th century. \n      1. Demand for fuel was driven in large part by the automobile and manufacturing industries. \n      2. At the beginning of the 20th century, natural gas became a viable product that burns cleaner than oil. \n      3. Today, a number of major private and state-owned companies dominate the global oil and gas trade.\n   2. As traditional oil fields were depleted, producers looked for new ways to extract oil and gas to maintain their supplies. \n   3. Although massive shale fields had been identified as potential sources of these resources, drilling technology was critically limited: it could not pump oil or gas through the dense rock. \n      1. Once engineers determined an effective way to fracture the shale to allow oil and gas to pass through (fracking), the technology caught up with other breakthroughs, like horizontal drilling, that allowed companies to take full advantage of shale fields. \n      2. Today, the technology is so successful that it is expected that demand for fossil fuels will run out long before the resources themselves do.",

So most social problems—such as inequality, political instability, death, disease, or famine—are wicked.\n   3. The indeterminate scope and scale make wicked problems into what we would call a type of ill-defined problem\n      1. And as we will see, the way to address them is to create a list of opportunities\n5. Reminder: What are Systems",

The goal then was to use those nested hierarchies as a way of exploring un-defined, and even ill-defined, problems\n   4. We will now take a more formal look at systems problems\n   5. So what is a system – a system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something\n   6. Therefore, all systems have three components – elements, interconnections, and a purpose\n6. Implications\n   1. In short, a system is always more than the sum of its parts\n      1. Famous example: if you take the best parts of 20 different automobiles, can you put them together to make a super-automobile",

We improve systems not only by improving the efficiency of individual elements, but by improving the effectiveness of the interconnections, and even by re-thinking the purpose of the entire system\n      1. Verganti is an example of the possibilities here\n7. Cause and Effect Diagrams\n   1. Systems can be mapped using causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams\n   2. Both are designed to visually display cause and effect relationships\n8. We are Always Embedded in a Larger System\n   1. As we saw earlier when looking at nested hierarchies, it is important to remember that whatever we are working on is embedded in a larger system\n   2. Our decisions are determined not only by the goals we have set, but by the goals and actions of others, as well as the side effects of both our own decisions and the action of others\n   3. Important – a systems map should make visual the distinction between intended actions and unintended consequences\n9. The Building Blocks: Feedback Loops  \n   1. All casual loop diagrams are constructed from two building blocks:\n      1. Reinforcing loops – positive feedback loops; the change in one direction compounds \n      2. Balancing loops which generate stability as they counteract the effects of reinforcing loops\n10. Directions of Change\n   1. In other words, reinforcing loops and balancing loops have directions – same and opposite\n   2. Same means the second variable moves in the same direction as the first variable\n   3. Opposite means the second variable moves in the opposite direction as the first variable\n   4. WORK THROUGH EXAMPLES ON SLIDE\n11. Example\n   1. Here is another small example\n   2. Notice how the goal comes from outside the loops\n12. Example\n   1. And here is another example\n   2. WORK THROUGH EXAMPLES ON SLIDE (start with the R loop)\n   3. Reinforcing loops generate growth and collapse, in which the growth or collapse continues at an ever-increasing rate. A small change builds on itself, resulting in big changes after some time.\n   4. Balancing loops generate stability. Balancing processes generate the forces of resistance, which eventually limit growth.\n13. You Try It – Where are the S’s and O’s",

Here is an object process map for baking bread – you can see how it combines objects and processes, which can be quite useful sometimes as opposed to a pure process map, or even a causal map\n   2.

In other words, it is any un- or ill-defined problem that offers up something interesting enough that can be turned into a well-defined problem that can actually be solved, and hopefully used to create a better future\n   3. Creating a Portfolio of Opportunities\n   1. One way to think about this idea of a portfolio comes from an interesting article published by McKinsey some years back\n   2. They argued that companies need to create a portfolio of innovation to reflect different time horizons\n   1. Now – make existing products better, faster cheaper; what we have called presentism – the problem is that this where the funding always is\n   2. New – what is the next product or service we can offer the market\n   3. Next – let’s disrupt our own business before competitors do\n   3. Think about it in terms of coffee\n   1. Now – how can we improve the taste of our leading brand of coffee\n   2. New – what new ways of brewing coffee can we develop\n   3. Next – what will replace coffee altogether\n   4.

    "content": "WELL-DEFINED PROBLEMS\n   1. Reminder: Problem Types\n   1. To repeat, innovation begins with finding problems worth solving\n   2. Those problems could be anything from the need to make small changes to a product, to identifying the company’s next blockbuster product, to how to take advantage of big changes occurring out there, to how wildly unpredictable futures could provide opportunities in the years to come\n   3. The first point is that these are all different kinds of problems\n   1. They exist on a continuum (hence the dotted lines), with different time horizons, different degrees of uncertainty, and they cannot all be addressed or “solved” in the same way\n   2. Un-defined problems are addressed by imagining different futures\n   3. Ill-defined problems are addressed by making lists, by trying to figure out what is the next big thing\n   4. They both help us build a portfolio of opportunities\n   4. But once you have the portfolio, the best ones need to be turned into well-defined problems so they can actually be solved\n   1. Which are the best ones\n – there is no formula\n   2. If the best ones are highly uncertain, then the traditional tools for prioritizing projects, such as DCF, will not help us much\n   3. So pick the ones that call your name\n   2. An Important Well-Defined Problem\n   1. Again, the goal now is to turn the best of the portfolio into well-defined problems that can actually be solved\n   1. Being well-defined says nothing about the particular solution, which may be easy to come by or hard; think about radar and sonar\n   2. Only what the solution needs to deliver\n   3. There are no lists here – only something that works or does not\n   2. Look at these examples – they were all extremely important problems, and not hard to find\n   1. Finding submarines – sonar\n   2. Finding bombers and massing fighters against them – radar \n   3. Quickly creating gunnery tables for artillery – computers\n   3. For these well-defined problems, the solution criteria were clear from the start, but incredibly difficult to find\n   3. Well-Defined Problems\n   1. Well-defined problems begin as opportunities, whether the clear sense that something does not work as it should or the idea that the future will be a very different kind of place where we will face very different kinds of problems\n   2. But whatever it is, all well-defined problems have falsifiable, specific, solutions\n   4. Formulating a Well-Defined Problem\n   1. Well-defined problems can be thought of as stories\n   2. One way to craft stories and to make sure you have all of the key elements is to use the five W’s\n   1. Just like you did in elementary school when they taught you how to read a newspaper\n   3.

A key goal of disaggregating problems through issue trees, mind maps, and MECE is to help us get at the root causes of well-defined problems\n   2. There are lots of techniques that are useful here:\n   1. GO THROUGH SLIDES\n   2. The five why’s\n   3. Fishbone diagrams using M’s, P’s, and S’s, which can also act as organizing principles for a mind map\n   3. Bottom line – getting at root causes helps us to not only define the problem clearly, but to start to imagine what a solution might look like\n   22. Exercise\n   1. Find the root cause of…\n   2. Use any of the techniques we just briefly mentioned\n   23. Exercise\n   1. Choose a problem\n   2. Find the root cause of the problem\n   3. Use issue trees to disaggregate the problem\n\n24. The Goal: Creating a Well-Defined Problem\n   1. To summarize, no problem can be solved in the traditional sense of the word unless it is well-defined\n   2. Innovation may start with thinking about un-defined and ill-defined problems, but they do not lend themselves to what we normally mean by solutions\n   1. They are simply ways of finding problems worth solving\n   3. But if you want to create a solution that can be built and sold and that will change the world, then you are going to have to define it clearly.  How",

More specifically, here are the steps\n   2. Research your opportunity, gather and organize what you find, disaggregate the problem in order to look for root causes, which then allows you to state the problem in terms of what a solution needs to deliver\n   3. Validate and iterate until you can put it all together in a clear sentence or two\n   26. Deliverable: A Well-Defined Problem\n   1. This is the first part of the end of term deliverable",

A well-defined problem means you have a good problem statement that makes clear the solution criteria, i.e. the specific outcomes expected\n   2. And should include the characteristics that you see here on the slide\n   29. Job to be Done: Cutting a Piece of Wood\n   1. Any task can be disaggregated into component steps using process mapping\n   1. Remember to think about how important the outcome is to you and how well-satisfied you are with current products, services and policies\n   2. Each step can then be analyzed in terms of a direction of improvement – minimize or maximize\n   3. Any step that can be improved is a problem to be solved\n   1. Some of those problems could be trivial\n   2. And some could be windows onto something big – it is a matter of judgment\n   30. Summary: Mapping Outcomes\n   1. A job map is a visual depiction of the core functional job, deconstructed into its discrete process or job steps, which explains in detail exactly what the customer is trying to get done. \n   2. A desired outcome statement includes a direction of improvement, a performance metric (usually time or likelihood), an object of control (the desired outcome), and a contextual clarifier (describing the context in which the outcome is desired).\n   3. We will use jobs to be done as a way of creating well-defined problems\n   31. Examples of Job Statements\n   1. Here are some examples\n   2. Process mapping, stakeholder analysis, and competitor analysis can also help here\n   3. The last four statements need to be better defined, but you get the picture\n   32. Exercise\n   1. For your best opportunity, the task now is to create a good jobs-to-be-done statement",

As you validate the solution, it should make you re-think the problem, and as you validate the business case, it should make you re-think the solution\n   2. How do you validate – research and talk to people\n   2. Peter Thiel’s View\n   1. Again, what are we looking for\n – something with enough uncertainty (market and technological) that it could be the NEXT big thing\n   2. We are not looking to replicate what is out there (e.g., the next Google) but create the next monopoly, the goal of all business\n   3. According to Peter Thiel, every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding \n   1. But branding is the result of market strength, not its cause\n   3. The Value Proposition\n   1. The core of the business case is the ability to develop and define a compelling reason to buy your specific solution, as compared to alternatives (and there are always alternatives)\n   2. A reason to buy is the very definition of a value proposition\n   4. Per ARINC: A B2B Value Proposition\n   1. For B2B solutions, defining a value proposition should be fairly straightforward and eminently rational\n   2. This thing helps improve our bottom line – it increases revenue and/or decreases costs\n   3. The problem becomes much more difficult when we are dealing with consumer products and services; not to mention changes in government policies\n   5. The Value Proposition: Pains and Gains\n   1. Value propositions can most simply be framed in terms of pains and gains\n   2. What you are adding and what you are ameliorating\n   3. And, of course, these need to be understood in terms of what you are actually trying to accomplish, the job you are trying to do, the progress you are trying to make in your life\n   6.
